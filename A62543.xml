            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord, upon my frequent remembrance of the <hi>depth of the Riches both of his Wiſdome,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.33.</note> and of his Knowledge,</hi> hath given me many and manifold occaſions to break forth in the words of the Apoſtles ſudden exclamation, <hi>How unſearchable are his Judgements! and his waies paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, ſuch hath been the tenor of his diſpenſations (and of the Appearance of ſome of them) of late years from out of thoſe unſearchable depths, as may well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us in the midſt of ſuch muſings, to cry out in the words of the Song of the Lamb, ſaying, <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty,
<note place="margin">Rev. 16 3.</note> Juſt
<pb facs="tcp:49133:3"/>and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints: Who will not fear thee, Oh Lord, and glorifie thy Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Oh ye <hi>faithful followers of the Lamb!</hi> who ſhall be able to fathom, and to meaſure the depth and heighth, the breadth and length of thoſe judgements which are yet to come upon the people, and the Princes of the earth? Wo, Wo, to the worſhippers and admirers of the Dragon, of the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, how terrible will Jehovah be unto the little Horn (the laſt power which lifts it ſelf up, againſt the Saints of the moſt High) after the expiration of the two and forty months?</p>
            <p>How will this little Horn, which goars our ſides, and puſheth us into corners, roar, when the Judgement ſhall ſit, and they (that is the Saints) ſhall take away his Dominion,
<note place="margin">Dan. 7.26.</note> to conſume, and to deſtroy it unto the end?</p>
            <p>And with what conſternation of mind will the proud <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the world, flye before the Lamb, and his followers, when the mighty Hunters themſelves ſhall be hunted from Mountain to Hill by the little handful of thoſe who ar redeemed from the earth? And whitherwill ye rune for ſhelter, Oh ye Tyrants! Who ſhall be
<pb facs="tcp:49133:3"/>your Lord Protector in the Day when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovahs fury ſhall be powred out like fire?

If the Sons of ancient Kings be hurried out of the world, to their own place, for their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and perſecutions, for their contempt of God, his Word and his Works? what will be the portion of the New Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Tyrants, who are but of yeſterday, and have not had time to take root in the earth, neither ſhall ever be able to confirm or eſtabliſh their Domination?</p>
            <p>But to contract, and call off my mind from expatiating upon this point; It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be confeſſed, That the ſudden loſs of ſo bleſſed an Inſtrument in the hand of Chriſt, in ſuch a juncture of time, may well be matter of aſtoniſhment, or of great grief to thoſe poor ſouls, who begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to halt betwixt two opinions, found preſent help and ſtrength adminiſtred to their feeble knees by his Miniſtry, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo their eyes anointed with Goſpel Eye-ſalve for the diſcovery of the preſent, and other Truths: It was no marvel, that they became ſo ſenſible of the uſefulneſs of ſuch an Interpreter in that populous City, as the deceaſed Author of the inſuing Sermons.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49133:4"/>
            <p> And indeed, We Priſoners, your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Companions in Tribulation, and in the Kingdome and patience of Jeſus Chriſt, could not refrain rejoycing with you, for the hopes you had, that he ſhould have <hi>been as an Arrow, or a poliſhed ſhaft in the hand of a mighty man</hi> (even the man Chriſt Jeſus) in ſuch a day as this; But, as the heavens are higher than the earth,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.9.</note> ſo are the Lords ways higher than our wayes, and his thoughts than our thoughts; We are taught to ſay, <hi>It is the Lord,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3 18</note> let him do with us alſo, as ſeemeth good to him,</hi> for indeed, we are not our own,
<note place="margin">1 Cor 6.20</note> we are bought with a price; whether we live or dye, we are the Lords,
<note place="margin">Rom. 14 8</note> and therefore we are obliged to glorifie him in our bodies, and in our ſouls.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to a brief Narrative of ſome particular paſſages and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may be of uſe for the Chriſtian Readers, who are far remote from the City to know: It is to be remembred, That this Servant of the Lord, had waited for ſome ſpace of time (<hi>viz.</hi> about a year of daies) to underſtand the mind of God, in reference to the work, which was upon his heart to do for the Lord Jeſus, at length perceiving his way to be plain before him,
<pb facs="tcp:49133:4"/>he came up to the City of <hi>London,</hi> where it pleaſed the Lord to put a period to his dayes, within a very ſhort ſpace after he was arrived: But how diligently he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his time and his talent, I need not declare, for its well known to thouſands, that he laboured, as if it had been for his life, to promote that glorious Cauſe (which was once the joy of the Saints, generally throughout the Nation, although now it be almoſt forgotten by the moſt) and the concernments of Chriſt and his people, in the midſt of a generation of Revolters and Backſliders, from the work of God in their day.</p>
            <p>Three principal buſineſſes he had upon his ſpirit to diſpatch:</p>
            <p>The firſt, was to ſpeak his mind freely to the Great Man (as they call him) which accordingly, after ſolemn ſeeking the face of the Lord with ſome Brethren, he did, and did bear his Teſtimony to his face in the firſt place, in the preſence of divers witneſſes, in ſuch a way of plaineneſs, and pity towards him, who was guilty of ſuch open Abominations, that undoubtedly it will be of uſe hereafter to the ſtopping of the mouths of all Court-flatterers (who are one of the worſt ſort of creeping Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the world) purpoſing moreover to
<pb facs="tcp:49133:5"/>proceed to an higher and more publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, as God ſhould give him a ſpirit and opportunity thereunto.</p>
            <p>In the next place, like another young <hi>Apollos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 18.27, 28.</note> being come to the City, <hi>he help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them much, who had beleeved (the preſent Truth) through Grace;</hi> for he mightily convinced many, and that publickly, that the Kingdome of Chriſt, is not only a Spiritual Kingdome, but an outward viſible Kingdome (as his words are) that this is a branch of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; That this Kingdome ſhall very ſhortly begin to break in peeces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all theſe Kingdomes; Inſomuch that the ſpirits of many precious ones were revived, their minds inlightened; Inſomuch, that methoughts I heard one Diſciple, that had been ready to faint and quail, ſaying to another Diſciple, in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi> language, <hi>See I pray you, how mine eies have been inlightned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I taſted a little of this Hony; This word of the Lord</hi> (concerning the glorifying of his Son in the ſight of all Nations) <hi>is ſweeter than the hony or the hony comb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh dear hearts, you <hi>who heard a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in him;</hi> Tell me, Did not your hearts wax warm, nay,
<pb facs="tcp:49133:5"/>
               <hi>did they not burn within you,</hi> while he ſpake of thoſe things to you, and <hi>while he opened to you (in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power) thoſe Scriptures,</hi> which do ſo neerly concern the King of Saints, and his Cauſe at this day?</p>
            <p>His next deſign was, to travel from Priſon to Priſon, where any of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt were ſhut up, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly made an entrance upon that work, in coming to this Caſtle to viſit us, <hi>as not being aſhamed of the teſtimony of the Lord, nor of us his Priſoners,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 11.8.</note> but appeared very willing to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the afflictions of the Goſpel (of the Kingdome) according to that</hi> meaſure of the power of God, which ſhould be given him, even to ſuffer bonds in the maintenance of that Cauſe, and glorious Truth, which formerly had been owned, but is now rejected by the General, and his Men of War; Inſomuch, that he would in private diſcourſe with ſome friends declare, That a Priſon was like to be his portion ere long. And no queſtion, if he had lived to have inlarged upon the ſigns of the times, and the Spirit of God had come upon him with power, the Supreme ſingle Perſon at his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters
<pb facs="tcp:49133:6"/>at <hi>White-hall,</hi> with the advice of his Cabinet Councel, would after grave and mature deliberation have found it very neceſſary, abſolutely neceſſary to have ſuſpended and ſilenced ſuch a Preacher, as neither knew how to hold his peace, nor yet to pipe to the tune of the New Inſtrument, for we muſt know that this New Monarchy is founded upon <hi>NECESSITY;</hi> Neceſsity is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother; Neceſsity and Policy are the Nurſe and the Guardian of this young Government. Alas, poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! it was born in a Conſumption, and beſides that, hath had many Convulſion fits, ſince it came into the world, inſomuch that its Friends and Phyſitians have had much ado to keep life in it at ſeveral cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical hours, ſince its Nativity: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide we ſhall find that Maxime true, <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum violentium eſt perpetuum,</hi> violent Motions, will quickly work Commotions, Confuſions, and Deſtructions; Let none take offence at this Language, for I cannot forbear vilifying the Kingdomes of the fourth Beaſt, when my thoughts are upon the magnifying of the Kingdome, Power, and Glory of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.

<pb facs="tcp:49133:6"/>holy modeſty) might, of old, be allowed by God himſelf, to deſpiſe the great King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and to laugh him to ſcorn, I know no reaſon to the contrary, but one of the Lambs followers, may without breach of rule, in an holy triumph of Faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs contempt of the Kings of the Earth, who are all of them the lovers of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But to return from this digreſsion of Neceſsity; Both Friends and Foes may eaſily conjecture, how warm an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it would have been to all of us to be refreſhed with his company, in the ſeveral Priſons, where wee, and our Brethren, are ſhut up, if it had pleaſed the Lord to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and ſo have given the word for the undertaking of his intended, ſpiritual, Summer-progreſs, for wee found him to bee indued with ſuch a Spirit, and to have ſo much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Lord and his Word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſent oppreſſed Truth and Work, that undoubtedly the Glorious Cauſe wherein we are ingaged, would have been ſo much the more inquired after, and ſearched into, by many of the Saints. But the Counſel of the Lord muſt ſtand.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49133:7"/>
            <p> By conference alſo with him here in my Priſon-chamher, I underſtood how long ſince, and upon what occaſion, the Lord had taken him by the hand, and brought him into his ſpacious Galleries to walk and take a proſpect of that part of Chriſts Kingdom, and glory, which is now ready to bee revealed in theſe laſt times.</p>
            <p>So that I now plainly diſcern this, in regard his day was to be ſo ſhort, he was thereupon ſpirited from the Lord to do much work in a little time; for thoſe <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration-works</hi> of his (his Books ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) together with his knowledge of the times, are no queſtion a ſpecial product of Providence in this ſeaſon, and may ſerve for the rouzing up and quickening of ſuch as are upon their watch, to look about them, that they may not be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>And for the rendring unexcuſable, that Generation of drouſie Profeſſors and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate pretenders, which this Nation ſwarms with at this day.</p>
            <p>Neither let it ſeem ſtrange to thee (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art that readeſt this) that the learned Rabbies, and the Orthodox Doctors of theſe times are ſo exceeding dumb as to this point, for firſt, conſider,
<pb facs="tcp:49133:7"/>It is not the high-way to Eccleſiaſtical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions; it is impoſsible they ſhould get or keep any great Church-livings; if ſuch Doctrine ſhould be preached by them, or imbraced by the people, as theſe Fift-King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom-men deſire and indeavor to leaven the land withall. And then ſecondly, It is according to the tenor of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Generations before us; ſuch myſteries uſe to be hidden (in their firſt diſcoveries at leaſt) from the wiſe and prudent, and were revealed unto Babes, that ſo no fleſh might glory in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let no man find fault, that the Lord takes ſuch unlikely Inſtruments to break the Ice, to prepare the way, nor yet take offence at that diverſity of Opinions and Apprehenſions which is and will be found for a little while, among the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Doctrine of Chriſts Kingdom in the approaching, glorious miniſtration of it.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſuch a thing is intimated and handled by this Author in his ſecond Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concerning the ſigns of the times, at the <hi>52</hi> page, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this will occaſion the true children of the true light to ſearch the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things there diſcuſſed be ſo or no; I confeſs I
<pb facs="tcp:49133:8"/>have ſome hope to be ſucceſsful in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the matter betwixt thoſe good men, by communicating ere long to publick view, (if not prevented) what I apprehend to be the mind of God in that particular. In the mean time I deſire the Lords little remnant <hi>(whom he hath reſerved to himſelf in this general Apoſtacie)</hi> waiting for the breaking forth of the next diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from under this dark cloud, to entertain theſe Sermons, of this Diſciple lately decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (taken in ſhort-hand from his lips, &amp; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe death prevented) not peruſed nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by himſelf) with that reſpect, which is due to the memory of ſuch a ſervant of Chriſt, whoſe praiſe (as we hear) is in all the Churches throughout <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> beſides other places where he hath travelled, teaching and preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But many men, who favour not my righteous cauſe, will be apt to ſay, <hi>This is ſtrange, could there not be found another friend of the Authors more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable among the people, and who ſhould have recommended theſe his laſt words and works unto them, with more advantage to the cauſe, &amp;c.</hi> We know that this man is a ſinner; <hi>He is an evil doer, or elſe why is he in Priſon?
<pb facs="tcp:49133:8"/>undoubtedly he was not put there, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he kept there, for his good deeds; It is much he ſhould be made uſe of in ſuch a work as this, for</hi> laudari a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to viro, illa, illa demum laus eſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> I have, in ſome meaſure learned of <hi>Job,</hi> not to ſtand upon my terms with the Lord, in point of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>I know it is ſo as you ſay,
<note place="margin">Job 9.2.</note> for how ſhould a man be juſt before God? if he will contend with him,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand. Though I were righteous, yet would I not anſwer him, but would make my ſupplication to my Judge.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.8.</note> And if I ſay I have no ſin I deceive my ſelf, and the truth is not in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 2.</hi> But as to men, I may plead my integrity with a good conſcience, and ſay with boldneſs, if things were examined from the bottom, from the beginning, I make no queſtion in the leaſt, but I ſhould be juſtified by the children of Wiſdom (I mean, not the wiſdom of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, <hi>who are coming to nought,</hi> but the wiſdom of God in a myſtery) for they would not <hi>judge according to outward appearance, but would judge righteous Judgement.</hi> Their Judgement (like the Lords, <hi>Rom. 2.2.</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:49133:9"/>would, I am ſure, be <hi>according to truth,</hi> and not <hi>according to intereſt,</hi> as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Machiavel</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> was.</p>
            <p>And (which is alſo the Lords mercy, I am perſwaded to all his impriſoned ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants now ſuffering for the good old cauſe) with me it is a very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be either commended or condemned by the men of this old evill world,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.19 1 Cor. 5. 1 Pet. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>which lieth in wickedneſs,</hi> for when we all come <hi>to give an account, to him who is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to judge the quick and the dead,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks? ſuch a ſentence will be pronounced, and ſuch an exact diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice will be made, that we are ſure, our ſubtle, proud perſecuters will be ſtript naked and bare of all their Swords, and Guns, their Gaolors, and their Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles, and beſides all this, <hi>their Clergy,</hi> which ſtands them inſtead here, will not be allowed them in that Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 3.</hi> It doth not neceſſarily follow, that becauſe I am a priſoner, therefore I muſt bee an evill doer, or a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, for we know <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and the Apoſtles were impriſoned, yet who will reckon them with tranſgreſſors, that pretend to be Chriſts Diſciples? yea, Chriſt himſelf was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered among the greateſt Malefactors of
<pb facs="tcp:49133:9"/>that time, wherefore, let no man be raſh to ſpeak evil of perſons and things which they have no acquaintance with.</p>
            <p>But to give the Reader a brief account, for the preſent, reſerving a larger Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to a fitter opportunity; I have been twice impriſoned by the Man, whom the people call <hi>His Highneſs,</hi> and their <hi>Lord Protector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt time there was an Arbitrary Power exerciſed by him, in cauſing me to be apprehended, for giving two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obſervations, and nine particular Characters of the Little Horn (mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Daniel</hi> the ſeventh) that day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was proclaimed, as they ſay, this ſhould have been preached the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but by providence I was prevented. So that here could be no colour for impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſidering I applied it to no perſon, for, as I told the people, (and I ſpake the truth) God had not revealed it to me as yet (but the day would declare it) to whom properly to apply it.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, when I was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, as a Priſoner, in the Councel Chamber, concerning the application of thoſe Characters, I told him what I had ſpoken in the preſence and hearing of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds concerning this matter, but withal I
<pb facs="tcp:49133:10"/>then declared to him in the preſence of his Creatures, <hi>That if the Lord had revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto me, who it was that the Holy Ghoſt meant by that Little Horn, I would have told the people, though I had died for it, when I had done:</hi> And then I added theſe other words; — <hi>But to deal plainly with you, my Lord, and to tell you my very heart, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I did not apply thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters unto you (at that time) was, becauſe, I thought (or judged) that you would not perſecute the Saints.</hi> For indeed till then, I never knew or heard that he had ſo done. But ſince that, what he hath done, and now doth, in this kind, let the ſpiritual man, who beſt diſcerns the difference of things, give his judgement. Hitherto, I know aſſuredly, that I was not in any fault, worthy of the leaſt reproof from man, much leſſe of bonds.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, there was another material paſſage, which I declare with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: I perceived by his large Speech, that which he fixed upon, as matter of Charge, was, <hi>that I was an Enemy to Government, and all my quarrel was againſt Government.</hi> Theſe were his very words, to which I choſe to make my
<pb facs="tcp:49133:10"/>defence at large, declaring firſt, my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of education, as <hi>Paul</hi> did (for I made his Apology my Pattern) and the manner of <hi>the Lords putting me into the Miniſtry (1 Tim. 1.12.)</hi> And then in the next place, I ſhewed him, how I had indeed preached againſt Epiſcopal Government, and then againſt the Kings Government, and that his Monarchy ſhould be deſtroyed; Then I declared alſo that I had indeed preached againſt the Presbyterian Government (as ſet up by the Parliament) and againſt the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or new faſhioned Synod, of Lords, Commons, and Clergy-men; And laſtly, againſt the Parliament (but not againſt that kind of Government which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for (for that I owned, ſo far as it was a Government for the Commonwealth, and the publick good.)</p>
            <p>But withall, as I declared theſe things freely concerning my ſelf, ſo I ſhewed him likewiſe from point to point, how He Himſelf had pulled down all theſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one after another. Firſt, The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Government, next the Kingly, then the Presbyteriall; after that, the long Parliament; ſo finiſhing this part of my Defence; I looked him ſtedfaſtly in the face, without fear, and ſaid in theſe very
<pb facs="tcp:49133:11"/>words, <hi>So that, my Lord, I conclude, if</hi> I <hi>am againſt Government,</hi> YOU <hi>are againſt Government; and if</hi> I <hi>have a Quarrel againſt Government,</hi> YOU <hi>have a Quarrel againſt Government alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, I have much muſed upon this Charge of his, <hi>for of all the men in the world, I admired (and do ſtill wonder) with what face</hi> HEE <hi>could find fault with me, and with what conſcience</hi> HE <hi>could accuſe me, and impute this as a crime worthy of cloſe impriſonment; when he knew in his own ſoul, that he had pulled down whatſoever I had preached down, from firſt to laſt</hi> (except his own new Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was not then publiſhed to the world) nevertheleſſe to cloſe priſon I muſt go.</p>
            <p>And yet do not know any colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or of Law for that uſage, unto this moment, neither is it poſsible I ever ſhould, for that impriſonment was contradictory to all principles of Reaſon, Juſtice, and Conſcience. All that can be ſaid, is this, he preſumed to give the Congregation to whom he was preaching, ſeveral Characters of the Little Horn, upon that very day, when the people cried (or ſhould have
<pb facs="tcp:49133:11"/>cryed, if they did not) <hi>God ſave His Highneſs,</hi> taking the Lords name in vain, after the old mode in King <hi>Charles</hi> his dayes.</p>
            <p>There hath been alſo (I underſtand from very many friends, who come to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me in Priſon) a great noyſe at Court (from whence it is ſpread up and down the City and Country) that I ſunk under him, when I was brought before him, and had not a word to ſay for my ſelf, and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> was perſwaded I was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and would forbear to preach as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this his ſaid Secretary will witneſs; this buſineſſe is frequently repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my abſence, being twenty miles off in priſon. I commend the Maſter and the Man, they would make the Saints, my friends, beleeve ſtrange things againſt me, when I am far enough out of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; But the Lord knows I never was conſcious to my ſelf of any thing in that kind; neither did I give occaſion for any man ſo to judge and report, for the truth is this, I was not affraid either of his looks or his threats in the leaſt, from firſt to laſt; neither was I at all convinced (by any thing that he ſaid) that I have done any evil in the ſight of the Lord, or of man, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I preached concerning the Little
<pb facs="tcp:49133:12"/>Horn (which (as I judge) was the cauſe of mine Impriſonment on his part,) never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, <hi>This</hi> I muſt needs ſay, and it is truth; When I heard the General ſpeak at ſuch a rate concerning <hi>IMPULSES</hi> (upon occaſion of ſomewhat I had a little before toucht upon) magnifying the fruits of ſuch <hi>Impulſes,</hi> as came upon his own ſpirit, as all excellent and glorious, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wonder, and thought it ſomewhat ſtrange to hear ſuch language, ſavouring of ſelf-exaltation; but when I heard him vilifie thoſe <hi>Impulſes</hi> which other Saints had experience of, judging their <hi>Impulſes</hi> to be from the Devil, condemning that ſpirit by which they ſpake, ſaying, <hi>Wee had forſaken the Head (Chriſt) and were under the Miniſtration of evil Angels, &amp;c.</hi> My Countenance (I verily beleeve) was very much changed, becauſe of that great trouble which fell upon my ſpirit in hearing ſuch words, bordering (as I then conceived) upon Blaſphemy; Hereupon, caſting my eyes up towards the wall over againſt me, and ſhaking my head, with much grief of heart to hear him, I conſidered in my ſelf, whether I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him concerning thoſe grievous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of his, or not, and even as I was reſolving in the negative, theſe words
<pb facs="tcp:49133:12"/>came into my mind (or were put into my mind) with power, <hi>Anſwer him not a word, Anſwer him not a word.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when he had done ſpeaking, I kept ſilence, and did not return a word, that I can remember; from this paſſage I am apt to think, they ſuppoſed I was convinced by what had been ſpoken by him, and had nothing more to ſay for my ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon have ſpread this untrue report, but they were, and are deceived in that matter.</p>
            <p>But at the end of three dayes and an half, I was ſet free, not making any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or yeelding to any terms which were propounded to me: I ſuppoſed they were not able to juſtifie what they had done; <hi>(for This Impriſonment was contrary to the Law of God, and of the Land, yea and contrary to his own Oath, which he had ſolemnly taken, but five dayes before in the preſence of many witneſſes)</hi> and ſo I have done for the preſent with my firſt Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>As for the cauſe of this ſecond Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment: It is as far from my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as the former, unleſs it be for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my teſtimony publickly againſt the <hi>open and notorious Abominations of the times;</hi> wherein the General and his
<pb facs="tcp:49133:13"/>Army are ſo involved, together with the Parochial Church-men, and the Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Profeſſors, that certainly there will overtake them a moſt ſore viſitation from the Lord, which will deſtroy their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of lyes, and tear their Inſtruments all to peeces; <hi>If this be to be vile, I will be more vile;</hi> If I muſt ſuffer Perſecution, Impriſonment, and reproach for this, the will of the Lord be done; <hi>I am made more than a Conqueror through him who hath loved mee.</hi> Shall not I be as bold to plead for the Lamb againſt the Beaſt, as they are to plead the cauſe of Antichriſt, againſt the Lord Jeſus? God forbid!</p>
            <p>I was indeed, after I was apprehended this ſecond time, brought before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Council, as they called it, where they cauſed to be read in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome paſſages of a Sermon at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallows</hi> two dayes before, and would have me to anſwer, whether I had ſpoken thoſe things, which ſome of their Purſevants or ſneaking Spies had brought unto them. It put me in mind of the perſecuting Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, who laid ſnares to intray the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God in their faithful preachings to the people. I told them, I would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirm nor deny any thing; <hi>but
<pb facs="tcp:49133:13"/>when they brought the Accuſers, and the witneſſes face to face, I would give them an Anſwer,</hi> and ſo we parted. After four or five dayes, they ſent me to <hi>Winſor</hi> Caſtle, and here I have been nineteen Months and more, and know not when I ſhall come to a Trial, they are a long time, methinks, in preparing the charge againſt me, ſurely they are to ſeek it, for I was in priſon before their Law was publiſhed; <hi>And where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would willingly know of ſuch as reproach me as an evil doer (and therefore I ſuffer juſtly) what is my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion, and what is my ſin? for if I am an Offender (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) or have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing worthy of death, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not to dye, or otherwiſe to be puniſhed according to my demerits, in caſe I have tranſgreſſed any Law of Righteouſneſs whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I humbly conceive that mine Impriſonment, doth not render me uncapable of writing to the Lords people, and therefore, theſe things not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for any but the followers of the Lamb, I ſhall deſire them not to condemn me, before they find me manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
<pb facs="tcp:49133:14"/>of thoſe notorious evils, which are reported againſt me.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the Lord hath given me an opportunity to teſtifie the truth, for the Cauſe ſake, wherein I ſuffer, and which the Author of theſe Sermons did own to his death; I hope no inconvenience can ariſe from this brief Apology thus briefly repreſented to the <hi>little Remnant of the Womans Seed,</hi> who (in theſe dayes of Hypocriſie and Apoſtacy) <hi>keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One word to my Fellow-priſoners, in this glorious Cauſe, from the Word of the Lord; and it is a part of thoſe glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which they, through Grace, may bee abundantly refreſhed in the remembrance of, as I have been in this long time of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, <hi>THERE REMAINETH A REST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD.</hi> A <hi>Sabbatiſme,</hi> ſo the Word is, an holy, ſolemn Reſt; and it hath reference, to the World to come, even the ſtate of the Saints in the Thouſand years: This hath been in all Ages good news to ſo many, as being pilgrims and ſtrangers for the Lords ſake in this preſent evil world, have been alwayes hated, reproached, oppreſſed, perſecuted,
<pb facs="tcp:49133:14"/>tormented, ſlaughtered, by the four great cruel wild Beaſts, <hi>Dan. 7.</hi> Oh what a <hi>voluminous Martyrology</hi> would that be, which can comprehend all the cruelties, bloody Maſſacres, and deſpiteful dealings with the Saints of the moſt High, which have been perpetrated upon this earth, ſince <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> which can exemplifie in punctual narrations of truth, all the Methods, Stratagems, Pretences and Policies, which Perſecutors, have, and will make uſe of, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing of that ſpirit, which with boldneſs, doth juſtly contradict them, in their wickedneſs and Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Its not a work for a finite creature to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, none are <hi>ſufficient Hiſtoriographers</hi> of theſe things, <hi>but the Three, who bear Record in Heaven, where there is a Book of Remembrance written for thoſe which feared Jehovah, and thought upon his Name in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord our God, and our Father, how ſweet is his preſence in a priſon, to his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſervants? <hi>Moſes eſteemed the reproaches of Chriſt greater Riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> And wee from the overflowings of Divine Love, have ſuch glorious Incombs, that we would not exchange, the leaſt of them, for all the gold and ſilver, which is coming from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to the New Court. As the noble Marqueſs <hi>Galeacius Caracciolus,</hi> when Golden Temptations were preſented, <hi>Let their money periſh with them, ſaith he, who account all the gold in the world worth one dayes communion with Jeſus Chriſt in the holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Brethren in Bonds, for the Lords ſake, How is it with you? Have you cheerful lively ſpirits? Do you live in the ſenſe of the love of God, ſhed abroad in your hearts, by the holy Spirit which is given to you? Doth your faith grow exceedingly? Doth your love and

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He three foregoing Chapters and this, they have a looke unto the laſt times; and they doe more particularly relate unto the times, in which God will gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> as in the 14 <hi>verſ. Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will performe that good thing which I have promiſed unto the houſe of Iſrael, and to the houſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49133:18"/>of Judah.</hi> I ſay, the Propheſie lookes to the time when the Lord will unite the ten Tribes, which are called <hi>the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> and the two Tribes, which are called <hi>the houſe of Judah,</hi> and will performe all thoſe good things that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them, in that day, when they ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be united together. Now among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bleſſed things the Lord hath promiſed unto his people in that day, this indeed is the chiefe and the great mercy, God hath promiſed A KINGDOME; for thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſhall never want a man</hi> (in the 17 <hi>verſ.</hi>) <hi>to ſit upon the Throne of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> We have a kingdome promiſed unto the people of God, (a Throne) at this day; and that is ſhadowed forth under the kingdome of <hi>David, Davids</hi> kingdome was a Type of Chriſts kingdome; and indeed, whereas this kingdome here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is ſhadowed forth by that of <hi>David,</hi> it doth hold thus much, <hi>That the kingdome, is not onely a ſpirituall kingdome, but an outward viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> for ſuch a Throne and kingdome <hi>Davids</hi> was. Now in the words that I read to you, the Lord gives aſſurance unto his people, that he would make good this promiſe; and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the Lord gives unto his people, is grounded on the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>David</hi> and leſt there ſhould be any doubt about the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>David,</hi> the certainty of it, the Lord tells us, that the Covenant made with <hi>David</hi> was as certain as the Covenant of the day and night, <hi>If you can breake my Covenant of the day and my Covenant of the night, that there ſhall not be day and night in their ſeaſon, then may alſo my Covenant be broken with David my ſervant.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49133:18"/>Why now the Covenant of the day and night hath been unalterable, from the firſt Creation unto this day, there hath been day and night in their ſeaſon; why ſo ſaith the Lord, my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>David</hi> its an unalterable an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Covenant, and upon this Covenant, this Throne and Kingdome I now promiſe to you is founded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> If ſo be you aske, What that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is that was made with <hi>David?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its Anſwered; If we doe but ſay it was <hi>an unchangeable Covenant,</hi> that Covenant is the new Covenant, where its ſpoken of, its ſpoken of as an Everlaſting and an unalterable Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and indeed this Covenant that the Lord doth here ſpeake of, is no other but that new Covenant, as is cleare from other Scriptures, 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 23. <hi>David</hi> when he was ready to dye, in his laſt words he doth make this his Comfort, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an Everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> So that the Covenant made with <hi>David,</hi> it was an Everlaſting Covenant, it was a ſure Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it was a Covenant that <hi>David</hi> had founded his very Salvation upon, &amp; therefore it could be no other but the new Covenant, the Covenant of grace. And ſo likewiſe the Prophet <hi>Iſai:</hi> 55.3 <hi>ver:</hi> he ſaith there, <hi>I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mercy's of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> The Covenant of <hi>David</hi> it was an <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant.</hi> Now this Throne and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is here promiſed to the houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and to the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and alſo to all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49133:19"/>the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well the ſpirituall as the naturall, the Gentills as the Jewes, which ſhould in this day become one with them, its founded and that upon <hi>the Covenant of David,</hi> and that is the Everlaſting Covenant, the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> the Covenant of grace; ſo that there ly's this truth before us;</p>

               <hi>That the kingdome (or viſible kingdome) of Chriſt its founded in the new Covenant,</hi> or, <hi>The doctrine of Chriſts kingdome its a part or Branch of the new Covenant.</hi> Something I ſhall ſpeake as to the clearing of this, and then ſpeake a few words by way of Application.</p>
            <p>As to the clearing of the Point, that it is ſo, that the kingdome of Chriſt its rapt up in the new Covenant; the glorious and bleſſed Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, hath this lodged up in it, as one maine peice of it, namely, a viſible kingdome. This is cleare if we doe but looke to the <hi>firſt ſtriking up of the Covenant betwixt the Father and the Son, between God and Chriſt in Eternitie.</hi> The new Covenant though it did come forth in Time (the promiſe of Eternall life came forth in Time) yet the foundation of it was laid in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; <hi>in hope of Eternall life</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began:</hi> ſo that the promiſe of Eternall life, that great bleſſing of the new Covenant, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Covenant it was laid in Eternitie, before the world began. Now if we doe but looke to the tranſactions paſt between God and Chriſt in Eternitie, at the ſtriking up of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we ſhall finde that this was one great branch, one great peice of the new Covenant, namely, <hi>a viſible kingdome;</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49133:19"/>ſhould have a kingdome, and be king, and have all his enemies under him here, it was one great peice of that Covenant that was made between God and Chriſt in Eternitie. In the 49 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> (which Propheſie is applyed by a worthy man unto the thing I am ſpeaking of, namely, the ſtriking up of the Covenant between God and Chriſt in Eternitie, its cleare the Propheſie doth run upon Chriſt, and) in the two firſt verſes (as he conceives) The Lord Jeſus is brought in, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how that his father had called him, and what worke his father had put into his hands for him to doe, and ſo he doth aske what he ſhould have for his labour, what wages he ſhould have for the doing his worke? And in the third verſe, the Lord comes and he doth offer to Jeſus Chriſt, as his reward and wages, <hi>Iſrael, thou art my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant O Iſrael, in whom I will be glorified.</hi> Now (as the ſaid perſon obſerves) Chriſt conſidering that theſe were but a handful, &amp; that they would many of them ſtand out againſt him, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, he thereupon complaines, <hi>my labour is in vaine, and I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and in vaine:</hi> If this be all my reward for my worke in dying, if I ſhould have no other reward then <hi>Iſrael,</hi> truly then I ſhould labour in vaine: and yet notwithſtanding Jeſus Chriſt is ſo willing to the worke, that he undertakes it however, ſaith he, my worke is of God, I will doe that worke, and I will even leave it to himſelfe, what reward he will give me. Now the Lord ſeeing Chriſt willing to take this worke upon him, he comes in the 6<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> verſe, and proffers more largely to him, <hi>And he ſaid, It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant, to raiſe up the Tribes of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49133:20"/>and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael: I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentills, that thou maiſt be my ſalvation, unto the end of the earth.</hi> Here the Lord comes in and doth proffer more largely and fully, he opens his heart more fully to Chriſt: Indeed here is the very concluſion, the reſult of all that did paſſe betwixt the Father &amp; the Son; now obſerve among thoſe things that the Lord doth promiſe to the Son, this is one, that he ſhall have a kingdome, in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the redeemer of Iſrael, and his holy One, to him whom man deſpiſeth, to him whom the Nation abhorreth, to a ſervant of Rulers, Kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, Princes alſo ſhall worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Lord, that is faithfull, and the holy one of Iſrael, and he ſhall chooſe thee.</hi> This is one great thing which was promiſed by the Father to the Son, and that from Eternitie, namely, a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that Chriſt ſhould have a kingdome, wherein Kings ſhould worſhip him, wherein Princes ſhould fall downe before him, and ſubmit to him, ſo that theſe things are ſpoken by the Prophet in Time, yet, as they were tranſacted betwixt the Father and the Son, they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time; and ſo the Lord had aſſurance of the kingdome wherein Kings ſhould fall downe and worſhip him, and that in Eternitie. But more clearely, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12 <hi>ver:</hi> where we have likewiſe the ſubſtance of the Covenant, that was betwixt God and Chriſt, the Father and the Son, and the tearmes and conditions of either party; Jeſus Chriſt for his part he is content that God ſhould <hi>bruiſe him,</hi> and to be <hi>greived,</hi> and that his ſoule ſhould become an <hi>offering for ſin,</hi> and make <hi>Interceſſion for Sinners:</hi> then the Father againe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49133:20"/>he promiſes on his part, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould <hi>ſee his ſeede,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>Juſtifie many,</hi> and the like; but obſerve among other, one ſpeciall thing that the Father promiſes is, that Chriſt ſhall <hi>have a Portion with the great, and ſhall divide the ſpoile with the ſtrong;</hi> this of all other is the great promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Now the Queſtion may be, what are we to underſtand by Gods dividing to Chriſt a portion with the great, and the ſpoile with the ſtrong?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why ſurely, theſe words they cannot be meant onely of Chriſts ſpirituall tryumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his enemies, and Chriſts ſpirituall reward; becauſe theſe words they are brought in as the reward the Father gives him for his ſuffering; becauſe he powred out his ſoule unto death, and was numbred with the Tranſgreſſors, and bare the ſins of many, <hi>therefore will I divide him a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoile with the ſtrong;</hi> therefore it cannot be a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reward, and the reaſon is becauſe the reward the Father gives to the Son, muſt be Equivolent unto his ſuffering, for the Father would not give unto his Son a reward that is ſhort of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, this were to look upon God as ſtraite hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (when Jeſus Chriſt had done his worke to give a reward ſhort of his worke) therefore the reward muſt be as large as his ſufferings. Now looke upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, and they are of two ſorts; There was ſpirituall ſufferings, and that in undergoing that bitter agony he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went in the garden, in encountering all the ſore Temptations of Satan, and all the frownes of his Father upon the Croſſe, here was aboundance of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49133:21"/>ſpirituall ſufferings, and he had the ſting and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins, his very ſoule was powred out unto death with it.</p>
            <p>But now Chriſt beſide theſe, had outward ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, he was made a reproach, and was buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he was nailed to the Croſſe, and he was peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now the reward muſt be as large as his ſufferings; if the reward were onely a ſpirituall reward, that would anſwer onely the ſpirituall part of Chriſts ſufferings, for ſo great was Chriſts ſpirituall ſufferings, that what ever he receives from the Father in a ſpiritual way, is but a full &amp; ſufficient reward for them: Now, what ſhall Jeſus Chriſt have for all his outward ſufferings? why ſurely, he muſt have ſome reward for theſe alſo; there muſt be ſomething that muſt be given by the Father to the Son, as a reward of theſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take it, that theſe words they are mainely that part of the reward, they doe hold forth the outward part of the reward; God had told him before, that he ſhould <hi>ſee his ſeede,</hi> and that he ſhould <hi>Juſtifie many;</hi> I but now, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt met with a great deale of ſuffering from the world too, therefore ſaith God, <hi>I will give him a portion among the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoile with the ſtrong,</hi> becauſe he was buffeted, and nailed to the Croſſe, and peirced; therefore the Father will give him a portion among the great, and he ſhall devide the ſpoile with the ſtrong; therefore I will honour him, and ſet him above the great, and above the ſtrong; and this ſhall be the reward of his ſufferings, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will give him a kingdome, and glory, and that as a reward of his ſufferings. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.13, 14, 15 <hi>ver: Behold my ſervant ſhall deale prudently,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49133:21"/>he ſhall be exalted, and extolled, and be very high. As many were aſtonied at thee, (his viſſage was ſo marred more then any man, and his forme more then the ſons of men) ſo ſhall he ſprinkle many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them ſhall they ſee; and that which they had not heard, ſhall they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</hi> My ſervant ſhall be <hi>exalted, and extolled, and be very high,</hi> who is this Gods ſervant? why, Jeſus Chriſt, he, whoſe viſſage was more marred then any mans, and his forme than the ſons of men, (to ſpeak of Chriſts ſuffering day) in Chriſts ſuffering day, his viſſage was marred, and he was without forme, or comelines, that is, he had no beauty, men were aſtonied at him, to look at him, ſeeing him ſo poore and ſo deſpiſed, that this ſhould be the Meſſiah and the Saviour of the world; well, ſaith God, though my Son hath been ſo debaſed, &amp; ſo diſhonoured in the world, yet I will exalt him above the great men of the world; and as the world have been aſtonied at him and deſpiſed him, Kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him, as much as to ſay, as men when in the preſence of a Prince or great man hold their tongues and are ſilent out of reſpect and honour; ſo, Kings and Potentates ſhall be ſilent in his preſence, in the day of Chriſts glory, though in Chriſts ſuffering day, every one ſpake againſt him, called him <hi>deceiver</hi> and <hi>Belzebub,</hi> and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon him; O yet there's a day, ſaith God, wherein my Son ſhall be exalted &amp; ſhall be very high, and then the Kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him, the great men of the earth ſhall be dumb, they ſhall not dare to ſpeake a word in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of him, there ſhall be ſuch a dread in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49133:22"/>day of his Glory; and truly, this too you ſhall ſee <hi>Phil:</hi> 2.6, 7, 8 <hi>verſes,</hi> Becauſe Chriſt when he was in the forme of God, and thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equall with God, was willing to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and to be trod upon, was willing to be of no account, that he might thereby glorifie his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſave ſinners; therefore ſaith the Lord, I will highly exalt him; <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow:</hi> ſo exalted, as every knee ſhall bow before him; we are not to underſtand this of the Popiſh bowing of the knee at the name of Jeſus, for ſuch creatures are ſaid here to bow the knee, that have no knees; and then too, as well every tongue ſhall confeſſe him, as every knee bow to him: But the meaning is this, that as Jeſus Chriſt had been diſhonoured in the preſence of men and Angells, ſo, a day ſhall come, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be ſo exalted by the Father, and that in the preſence of men and Angells, that all men and Angells, all creatures in heaven and earth, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, they ſhall all bow to Chriſt, that is, ſubject to him, worſhip before him, and every tongue ſhall acknowledge that this Jeſus that was crucified, and made a reproach at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he was the Lord Chriſt, the glory of God the Father, ſo that Jeſus Chriſt is to have a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wherein all his enemies are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feete, ſubjected to him, and this as the reward of his ſufferings; This is the ſum of that that hitherto I have been ſpeaking of, <hi>that it was a thing that was concluded upon between God and Chriſt even in Eternitie, when the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Covenant of Grace was laid, that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49133:22"/>Lord Jeſus Chriſt in recompence of what he was to doe here on earth, for the bringing about the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners, ſhall in reward of his worke have a glorious kingdome given to him by his Father, ſo that this kingdome of Chriſt, its founded in the new Covenant, in the very firſt ſtriking of it up betwixt the Father and the Son.</hi> But then</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Its cleare if we looke unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of it;</hi> the firſt Promulgation of the new Covenant, was to man immediatly upon the fall, ſo ſoone as <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, the Lord comes to him, and in the Lords firſt words of promiſe to him, we have couched this thing, that we are ſpeaking of, namely, the kingdome of Chriſt; yea, it was one great part of it, <hi>that Chriſt ſhould have a viſible kingdome:</hi> I take it that that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that we have in <hi>Gen:</hi> 3.16. <hi>The ſeede of the woman ſhall breake the Serpents head;</hi> that it doth very clearely hold forth this thing, as will appeare if we doe but conſider, as,</p>
            <p>Who is meant by the ſeede of the Woman, ſo likewiſe</p>
            <p>What we are to underſtand by breaking the head of the Serpent.</p>
            <p>Its not queſtioned but that the ſeed of the Woman is Jeſus Chriſt, who was borne of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Fathers due time.</p>
            <p>Now about the breaking the head of the Serpent, is the Queſtion; There may be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether that the breaking of the Serpents head, were onely a ſpirituall victory &amp; conqueſt, obtained by Chriſt over the Serpent &amp; his ſeed; or, whether there be not ſomething further in it. Now indeed I conceive, that though there is that in it, namely, Chriſts ſpirituall victory and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49133:23"/>conqueſt, yet there is more in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that this breaking the head of the Serpent, doth alſo hold forth an outward victory and an outward try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, an outward glorious conqueſt, that Chriſt and his, ſhould have over the Serpent and his ſeede. And the reaſon is this, <hi>That this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Serpent and his ſeede its come upon them, as a recompence of what the Serpent and his ſeede, have done or ſhould doe to the woman and her ſeede;</hi> to breake the Serpents head, its brought upon him as a puniſhment, as it were by the law of Retaliation, like for like, he had been brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he had been doeing all the miſchiefe he could, and God foreſaw he would doe all he could, therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>the woman and her ſeede ſhall breake the Serpents head, and his ſeede;</hi> now this being ſo, <hi>looke how the Serpent hath bruiſed the heele of the woman and her ſeede; in like manner, muſt the woman and her ſeede, breake the head of the Serpent and his ſeede;</hi> but now the Serpent hath not only bruiſed the heele of the woman and afflicted her ſeede in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way, by ſpirituall Temptations, he hath not done this onely; but this Serpent hath afflicted the woman outwardly; the Serpent hath been afflicting of the woman, one while by cauſing of Rents and Diviſions among the womans ſeede; another while, by raiſing up perſecution againſt the woman and her ſeede; he hath in an outward way afflicted the woman and her ſeede, therefore there ſhall be a day wherein Jeſus Chriſt and the faithfull of God, his faithfull Children ſhall breake the head of the Serpent and his ſeede, in an outward way; there muſt be ſuch a day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this comes in as a juſt recompence of what the Serpent had done to them.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49133:23"/>
            <p> Now if we ſhould but looke whither or no there hath been ſuch a day at any time as yet, truly we cannot finde ſuch a day, for if ſo be we ſhould looke into former times, and run through the times of the old Teſtament, we ſhall finde that the whole time was (in a manner) the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents day: in the morning of the old Teſtament, what blowes doth the Serpent give to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeede, when he held them in that ſore bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and in the evening of the old Teſtament, what a fearefull blow doth he give againe to the womans ſeede, in that great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peircing of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God into all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world? Let us looke into the morning and evening of the old Teſtament, and we ſhall finde that the Serpent had not his head broken, but he was an affliction to the woman all that time: and though its true indeede, the middle of that day was ſomewhat more calme and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, the woman and her ſeede having ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, under ſome of the Judges and good Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and was able to beare up her head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Serpent, and now and then to give him a blow; yet it was not like the breaking of his head, there was no ſuch thing as the breaking of his head; but now there ſhall a time come, wherein the Serpent ſhall have his head broken, that is, he ſhall receive a more deadly blow from Jeſus Chriſt, and thoſe that are his, then ever he hath given to them; for its a greater thing to have the head broken, than to have the heele bruiſed. And if we looke to the new Teſtament times, this hath never been done yet; for the firſt three hundred yeares, that great red Dragon, the Pagan Roman Empire, did perſecute with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49133:24"/>moſt bloody Rage, the woman and her ſeede, and was red with her blood, <hi>Rev:</hi> 12.3, 4. and as ſoone as ever the Dragon, the Pagan Power was off the Stage, then comes the Beaſt, and he follows that courſe the Dragon before him had done, of perſecuting the woman, for 1260 yeares, and ſhe all that time is in the wilderneſſe, in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes, which time is but now expiring, ſo that if we looke to the new Teſtament, even unto this day, its cleare, that the Dragon and the Beaſt, have afflicted the woman; therefore yet, the woman hath not had her day upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but there is a time wherein the woman muſt have a day upon the Serpent to breake his head; therefore there is ſuch a kingdome wherein the Saints of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall cruſh all the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt in the world.</p>
            <p>The whole time of the world is held forth by two great dayes; There is the day of the ſeede of the Serpent, and there's the day of the ſeede of the woman. Firſt, the Serpents ſeede have the day, and that day all their worke is to afflict the woman, to perſecute the Saints, but all that ever they can doe is but to <hi>bruiſe her heele,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſtroy her: I, but there's a day which the woman, and the ſeede of the woman is to have; now that is after the Serpent hath had his day, and in that day the ſeede of the woman, <hi>breakes the head</hi> of the Serpent, that is, gives a deadly blow unto the Serpent, and the ſeede of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; that as the woman hath been afflicted by the Serpent, ſo he ſhall receive a deadly blow from her: ſo that in the firſt promiſe that was made to man after he was fallen, truly there was this, the viſible kingdome of Chriſt; and we may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49133:24"/>ſay that this notion of the fifth Monarchy (as now its called) or of the viſible kingdome of Chriſt, truly its not a new fond notion, (though things may be ſaid to be new, in reſpect of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and our looking into them, yet) its as ancient as any truth in the whole word of God; in the very firſt promiſe wherein was laid the foundation of our Salvation, there was laid the foundation of Chriſts kingdome: Gods glory and mans happines goe together, as the glory of God ly's in our happineſſe, ſo the glory of Chriſt ly's in the glory of his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Againe, let us looke Thirdly, <hi>unto the new Covenant in the Renovation of it;</hi> as in the firſt making of it, and in the firſt Promulgation of it to man, we have this (as I have ſhewed you) as one great branch of it the kingdome of Chriſt; ſo looke unto the Renovation of it, God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new this Covenant againe and againe, and in the renewing of it, he did alwayes include this thing as a maine branch of it, namely, Chriſts viſible kingdome. I doe ſpeake this the more fully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I take it here ly's a maine foundation for our faith in this great thing that is controverted in this day, namely, the kingdome of Chriſt; for we all looke for ſalvation by the new Covenant, we all know the new Covenant is an Everlaſting thing, and what ever is in the new Covenant is like it ſelfe, unchangeable and Everlaſting, and if therefore the viſible kingdome be a peice or branch of that, then ſuch a thing there muſt be. Now, I ſay, look <hi>into the renewing of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and we ſhall finde that there is likewiſe this kingdome held forth: the new Covenant was twice more eſpecially renewed, or with two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49133:25"/>more eminently, namely, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Covenant was renewed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore its oftentimes called <hi>the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with Abraham:</hi> Now if we looke into that, we ſhall finde the great thing that was held forth in it, is this, of Chriſts viſible kingdome, wherein Chriſt ſhall bare Rule over all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, conquer all his enemies; if we looke unto this Covenant as renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the <hi>Galatians</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this promiſe apply's it to Chriſt; now looke upon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that were made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and we ſhall finde this truth, that there was ſuch a thing held forth as an outward viſible kingdome, <hi>Gen:</hi> 22.16, 17, 18 <hi>ver: And ſaid, by my ſelfe have I ſworne, ſaith the Lord, for becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon; That in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtarres of the heaven, and as the ſand which is upon the ſea ſhore; and thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed; becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice. Thy ſeed,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He ſaith not, to ſeeds as of many, but unto ſeed, as of one, Chriſt;</hi> and that here it muſt be underſtood not of <hi>ſeeds as many,</hi> but of the <hi>ſeed, as one, the ſeed, Chriſt,</hi> is cleare, becauſe its ſaid, <hi>thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his Enemies,</hi> not the gate of <hi>their</hi> Enemies, which if it had been ſpoken of <hi>ſeeds</hi> as many, it ſhould have been, but its the gate of <hi>his Enemies,</hi> and ſhew's that its ſpoken of Chriſt; now that which is promiſed is, that <hi>Chriſt Abrahams ſeede
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49133:25"/>ſhall poſſeſſe the gate of his Enemies;</hi> there ſhall be a day wherein Chriſt ſhall poſſeſſe the Gate of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt:</hi> What is the meaning of that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> Why truly the meaning is this, that a day ſhall come wherein Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have power over all his Enemies in the world, he ſhall have rule over his Enemies, he that hath been trodden upon in his members; we cannot ſay that he hath ruled over his Enemies yet, but a day ſhall come wherein he ſhall have an abſolute rule over his Enemies; which is expreſſed here by the <hi>Gate;</hi> as when a Conqueror comes againſt a City or Caſtle, when he hath once poſſeſſed the gate, he hath gotten the ſtrength of it, and they are all under him, and at his mercy; ſo there ſhall a day come; wherein Chriſt ſhall poſſeſſe the <hi>gate of his Enemies,</hi> they ſhall all be brought under him, in ſuch a manner, as they ſhall be all ſubject unto Jeſus Chriſt and his. But now there hath never been ſuch a day as yet, indeed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of Chriſt they have hitherto poſſeſt <hi>his Gate,</hi> if you looke from the firſt day to this day, the Enemies of Chriſt have ever been in <hi>his Gate,</hi> that is, they have been treading the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoote, which is moſt properly <hi>his Gate;</hi> But there is a day wherein Jeſus Chriſt ſhall poſſeſſe <hi>their Gate,</hi> and tread them underfoote; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is ſuch a thing as a viſible kingdome held forth in this promiſe made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Looke but to that promiſe made, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus; <hi>For the promiſe to Abraham, was not to Abraham, or to his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> The promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> that he ſhould
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49133:26"/>be heire of the world, was not to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to his ſeed through the Law; there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe expreſly made to <hi>Abraham</hi> that he ſhould be heire of the world, we doe not finde this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in ſo many words, therefore it ſeemes to me, that the Apoſtle doth gather up the ſumme of all the promiſes made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and he doth ſum up all in this, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to <hi>Abraham</hi> that he ſhould be heire of the world. All the promiſes, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be a father of many nations; all nations ſhould be bleſſed in him, his ſeede ſhould poſſeſſe the gate of his Enemies; what is that now that is the great thing held forth in all thoſe promiſes? why, it was that he ſhould be <hi>heire of the world;</hi> and the promiſe therefore is of ſuch a thing, and indeed it was the ſubſtance of them all, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> marrow of them, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould <hi>be a great and an abſolute heire,</hi> and ſhould have all the world given to him.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider this, its the promiſe of God, and he cannot lye; <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe never did poſſeſſe the whole world, but was a ſtranger in it, dwelling in Tents and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9. And if we looke to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> namely, the Jewes, they never yet poſſeſt more than that little ſpot of land, the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they have been caſt out of that a long time; and if we looke unto the beleiving Gentills the ſpirituall ſeed, they have been to this day perſecuted in the world, its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts, the of-ſcouring of it, and cannot in any ſence be ſaid to have been made poſſeſſors of the world, as an heire (which is the Apoſtles word) is made a poſſeſſor of his Inheritance, where he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49133:26"/>beares rule as a Lord, and all within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his Inheritance, are to him in no other capacity but of ſervants and Tenants. <hi>Abraham</hi> was the heire of it, but they never had the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it; yet there is a time wherein they ſhall have the world, for God who made the world, and hath given it to whom he pleaſeth, was pleaſed of his own good will to give it to <hi>Abraham:</hi> indeed, what right had <hi>Abraham</hi> to the land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> but God who hath right to all, was pleaſed to give it to <hi>Abraham:</hi> why ſo here, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed have the world given them; there muſt be a time wherein the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſhall poſſeſſe the world, as truly as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> did poſſeſſe the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. Now, I ſay, this hath not been, and we cannot looke upon this as if ſo be the fulfilling of this promiſe were in giving them a part of it; for God promiſes the world, and therefore indeed there is a time wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed are to be poſſeſſed of the world, and if ſo be there were not, what were <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed the better for the promiſe, if ſo be they never poſſeſſe it. And this promiſe is ſaid to be made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham not through the Law, but through the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith,</hi> and that is upon the account of the new Covenant; for in the <hi>Romans</hi> its ſaid, <hi>That the righteouſneſſe which is of faith ſpeakes on this wiſe,</hi> he doth oppoſe the old Covenant unto the <hi>righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> ſo that by the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith</hi> we are here to underſtand, the <hi>new Covenant;</hi> and this promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> as the heire of the world, and that as of the righteouſneſſe of faith, comes in upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the new Covenant.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49133:27"/>
            <p> Let me adde one notion more upon this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that this promiſe is made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>heire of the world,</hi> the Lord he doth give to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a pledge, or as an earneſt of this great promiſe, the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to him and his ſeed: and now as <hi>Abraham</hi> while he was a ſtranger in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he had the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> given to him and his ſeede by God, and ſo had a true right to it; ſo, Jeſus Chriſt, though he is now a ſtranger in the world, little knowne in the world; and the ſeede of Chriſt wander as ſtrangers in the world, yet they have a true right, and Chriſt hath a true right unto this great heiredome of the whole world, as true a right as <hi>Abraham</hi> had unto the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when that idneeed he was but a ſtranger in it; and looke as <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed the Jewes upon their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were by God poſſeſſed of that land, which God did give to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a pledge or an earneſt of the great Inheritance; ſo likewiſe ſhall <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed both naturall and ſpirituall, Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, (for now they are both one, for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wall is broken downe) this ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when God ſhall ſet his hand the ſecond time, gathering together his people, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.11. that is, when he ſhall deliver his Children from the Antichriſtian Tyranny and bondage, and he ſhall bring the Jewes into their own land, in that day ſhall they as truly be poſſeſt of this great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the whole world, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeed when they went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> were poſſeſt of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and to make this a little out, firſt <hi>Abraham</hi> was made by God an heire of the whole world, and that indeed is the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49133:27"/>great Inheritance that is here promiſed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> was as to an heire of the whole world. And ſecondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> was made an heire of a leſſer inheritance, and that was given by God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede, to live upon (as I may ſo ſay) untill the appointed time came, that they ſhould poſſeſſe the whole world; now one was the pledge of the other, and anſwerable hereunto, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed have two great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities, of which one was the Type of the other. Firſt, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed was carried captive into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in Gods due time God brings them out, and when he had brought them out, God puts them into that land that was the pledge of that great Inheritance; now after that, they ſin againſt God, and he delivers them into a greater and longer Captivitie; ſo likewiſe, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed (who wonderouſly increaſed in the time of their firſt Captivity in <hi>Egypt</hi>) in the time of this long Captivitie doe wonderfully encreaſe, for now the Gentills come in, and they are his ſeed; now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is made the father of many Nations; now <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede being encreas'd to a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Nations as the promiſe is, God will bring them forth a ſecond time; and as he did upon the firſt bringing them forth, he gave them the land which was the type of the promiſe, ſo at the ſecond time of bringing them forth, he will give them the whole world which he hath promiſed to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Looke upon the Renewall of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with David;</hi> as the new Covenant was renewed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo likewiſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with <hi>David;</hi> the renewall of it with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> we have if we looke into the 89 <hi>Pſalm:</hi> 3 &amp;

Thy ſeed will I Eſtabliſh for ever: and build up thy Throne to all Generations, Selah,</hi> What this Covenant is, obſerve in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Thy ſeed will I eſtabliſh for ever; and build up thy Throne to all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that is the great thing, the great branch of the Covenant made with <hi>David, I will build up thy Throne;</hi> but whoſe Throne is this, <hi>Davids</hi> Throne as <hi>David?</hi> no, its not <hi>Davids</hi> Throne, but indeed Chriſts, ſpoken of under <hi>David</hi> as a type of Chriſt as King; and that is cleare if you looke into the 19 <hi>ver: Then thou ſpakeſt in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to thy holy one, and ſaidſt, I have laid helpe upon one that is mighty: I have exalted one choſen out of the People.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> here, its cleare its ſpoken of Jeſus Chriſt, though <hi>David</hi> was the type of Chriſt, that mighty one: and then againe, its more cleare in the 27 <hi>ver: Alſo I will make him my firſt-borne: higher than the Kings of the earth. I will make him my firſt-borne;</hi> Its Jeſus Chriſt that is the Fathers firſt-borne, and its Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that is to be exalted higher than the Kings of the earth; <hi>David</hi> was never exalted higher than the Kings of the earth, there have been Kings of the earth, that have been higher as to outward glory than <hi>David</hi> was, but its Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that is exalted higher than the Kings of the earth. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt:</hi> How doth it appeare that this is the new Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> Why, it appepres from two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It appeares <hi>from the unalterableneſſe of it,</hi> in the 34 <hi>ver: My Covenant will I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lipps.</hi> It
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49133:28"/>was ſuch a Covenant that this kingdome was founded upon, that God would not breake nor alter, and therefore the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe there was <hi>an oath added to the Covenant,</hi> in the 35 <hi>ver: Once have I ſworne by my holines, that I will not lye unto David.</hi> Here's the oath of God, <hi>Once have I ſworne ſaith God,</hi> doe you thinke that I will be falſe to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Once have I ſworne,</hi> and that, <hi>by my holines,</hi> the higheſt thing God could ſweare by. Now it muſt therefore be the new Covenant, becauſe there's an oath added to it; when the Lord made the old Covenant, there was no Oath went with that, therefore the Apoſtle in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> ſaith, that the Prieſts of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were made without an Oath, but now the Prieſts of the new Covenant they are made with an Oath, 20 &amp; 21 <hi>ver:</hi> The Prieſthood of the new Covenant is confirmed by an Oath, what ever God doth in the new Covenant there goes an Oath with it; and ſo when Chriſt is made the high Prieſt of the new Covenant, the Lord ſweares, what ever he doth, I will doe, what he doth as a Prieſt, I will ratifie and confirme it, I will never repent me of it, there's an oath; but now the Prieſts of the old Covenant are made without an Oath; and becauſe its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by an Oath, its cleare it was the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the whole new Covenant hath an Oath goes with it, <hi>God willing to ſhew unto the heires of promiſe the Immutability of his promiſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes it with an Oath, that by two Immutable things, in which it was Impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> &amp;c. So that its cleare this is the new Covenant: I but here's
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49133:29"/>one promiſe hath a ſpeciall Oath to it, its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy obſervation what peice of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the Lord eſpecially ſweares to, and that is <hi>this promiſe of Chriſts kingdome, Once have I ſworne by my holines, that God will not lye to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> and what is that that God ſweares to? its this, that <hi>his ſeede ſhall endure for ever, and his Throne ſhall be as the Sun before him.</hi> Now to this promiſe is added a ſpeciall Oath, and its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the Lord ſpeakes of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeverall times in Scripture (there are foure times that the Lord ſpeakes of this) and he doth ſweare to it.</p>
            <p>When he made <hi>this Promiſe to Abraham, that his ſeed (Chriſt) ſhall poſſeſſe the Gate of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> Gen. 22.16. <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworne,</hi> ſaith he: when he comes to make <hi>this promiſe to David,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have a kingdome, God ſweares againe, <hi>Once have I ſworne by my holines, that I will not lye unto David; His ſeede ſhall endure for ever; and his Throne as the Sun before me.</hi> Againe, if you looke into <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.13. you have God ſwearing againe there, <hi>I have ſworne by my ſelfe; the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſſe and ſhall not returne, that unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſweare</hi> Why, what is the meaning of that? why its the very ſame with that in the <hi>Philippians,</hi> every knee ſhall bow to Chriſt, every tongue ſhall confeſſe that Chriſt is the Lord, it is the exalting and ſetting up Chriſt Jeſus as King: So, if we looke into <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.9.11. <hi>Oh thou afflicted, Toſſed with Tempeſt, and not comforted;</hi> and in the 14 <hi>ver: In righteouſneſſe ſhalt thou be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and thou ſhalt be far from oppreſſion;</hi> its a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49133:29"/>deſcription of Chriſts kingdome, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes by his oath in the 9<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> 
               <hi>ver:</hi> ſpeaking of this very time of the kingdome of Chriſt, <hi>For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have ſworne that the waters of Noah ſhall no more goe over the earth; ſo have I ſworne, that I would not be wrath with thee, nor rebuke thee;</hi> that is, he would not in that day be wrath with his people, ſo as to put by the fulfilling this good word of his promiſe, I will make good this peice of my Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now if we conſider it, ſurely there is ſomething in it, that the Lord ſhould confirme all the new Covenant by an Oath, and ſhould confirme one branch of it, and that by an Oath, ſwearing by <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and by his <hi>holines,</hi> and by his <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> and ſwearing that he would <hi>not lye;</hi> and ſwearing that it ſhould be as <hi>certain as the word to Noah,</hi> that the world ſhould never be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe. That the Lord ſhould ſweare over and over to it, ſurely there is much in it; now the Lord hath done thus as to Chriſts kingdome, what ever the world ſay, the Lord hath founded this upon the new Covenant, and he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this new Covenant with an Oath, when the Lord ſaw what oppoſition there would be in the world, &amp; what diſtruſt in his peoples hearts, leſt any ſhould doubt of it, he comes over and over againe with this particular branch of it with an Oath, I have ſworne, I have ſworne, I have ſworne, that my Son ſhall have a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So that in the Covenant with <hi>David,</hi> there was the promiſe of the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Let us come to the worke it ſelfe, where the worke doth begin to riſe in the world,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49133:30"/>and you ſhall ſee that it doth begin to riſe, and that upon the account of the new Covenant.</hi> The worke of Chriſts kingdome, the glorious beginning of it, it ſhall be about the time of the Jewes coming in, and indeed the coming in of the Jewes ſhall be a very great advancement of this kingdome, and where ever the Lord doth ſpeake of the coming in of the Jewes, he doth lay it upon the foundation of <hi>this new Covenant;</hi> and indeed its a very great argument to me, againſt thoſe that thinke there is no ſuch thing as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, becauſe God hath ſo often laid it upon his <hi>new Covenant.</hi> Looke into the 26 of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> the Lord had ſpoken before of reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and of the caſting of them off, 42 <hi>ver:</hi> he ſaith when they ſhould be caſt off, <hi>then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and alſo my Covenant with Iſaac, and alſo my Covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the Land.</hi> This doth not onely looke to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a time, when they were carried Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> for that was a rejecting onely of part of the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> but it doth looke to their long Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, of all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for theſe many hundred yeares, the Lord engages he will reſtore them, and reſtore them upon the account of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his Covenant; <hi>Then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and alſo my Covenant with Iſaac, and alſo my Covenant with Abraham, will I remember, and I will remember the Land:</hi> and I will bring them backe againe, and I will gather them upon the account of my Covenant, ſaith God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.30, 31. In the 27 verſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had been ſpeaking, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſcatter you
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49133:30"/>among the nations, and yee ſhall be left few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber among the heathen, whither the Lord ſhall lead you;</hi> then he tells them in the 30 verſe, <hi>When thou art in tribulation, and all theſe things are come upon thee, even in the latter dayes, if thou turne to the Lord thy God, and ſhalt be obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his voice:</hi> even in <hi>the latter dayes,</hi> mind the expreſſion, <hi>in the latter dayes, if thou turne to the Lord thy God, and ſhalt be obedient unto his voice, (for the Lord thy God is a mercifull God) he will not forſake thee, neither deſtroy thee, nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he ſware unto them.</hi> When the Lord hath caſt them off, they ſhall be gathered, and that upon the account of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and ſo in the 54 of <hi>Iſai.</hi> that Chapter is a propheſie of the Converſion of the Jewes, and of that glory that ſhall follow thereupon, and the Lord doth engage his Covenant for the bringing of it about. <hi>The mountaines ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and the hills be removed, but my kindneſſe ſhall not depart from thee; neither ſhall the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> So likewiſe in the 33 of <hi>Jere.</hi> the two laſt verſes; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, if my Covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the Ordinances of heaven and earth: then will I caſt away the ſeede of Jacob, and David my ſervant, ſo that I will not take any of his ſeede to be rulers over the ſeed of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob: for I will cauſe their Captivity to returne, and have mercy on them.</hi> This is ſpoken of their laſt reſtoration, as I told you at firſt, and the Lord doth engage to reſtore them, and for that, he doth engage his Covenant, if ſo be that my Covenant be not firme, then ſaith he may I caſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49133:31"/>away <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> my ſervant; but if you beleive my Covenant, doe not beleive I will caſt them away; <hi>Exod:</hi> 19. When the Lord had caſt them off, in reſpect of the old Covenant, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers them upon the account of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, his Everlaſting Covenant. So likewiſe, <hi>Zach:</hi> 9.11. which Chapter is a propheſie that lookes into the laſt times, as is cleare from the firſt verſe, for it lookes to the time, wherein <hi>all the eyes of Iſrael ſhall be toward the Lord;</hi> ſo you have what is ſpoken in the 9th <hi>ver:</hi> quoted by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew; Thy king cometh riding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Aſſe, and upon a Coalt, the foale of an Aſſe;</hi> its cleare it lookes unto the laſt times: ſo, if you looke into the 10 <hi>ver: And I will cut off the Charret from Ephraim, and the Horſe from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: and the battell bow ſhall be cut off; and he ſhall ſpeake peace unto the Heathen, and his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhall be from Sea, even to Sea, and from the River, even to the ends of the earth;</hi> it lookes to the time of Chriſts kingdome; now in that time God will gather together the Jewes, in the 11 <hi>ver: As for thee alſo, by the blood of the Covenant, I have ſent forth thy Priſoners out of the Pitt, wherein is no water.</hi> The Lord will gather them in that day, and that upon the account of the new Covenant, <hi>by the blood of the Covenant</hi> they are gathered. And as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of the converſion of the Jewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. He ſpeaking of the naturall ſeede that were broken off that we might be graffed in, and how that they ſhould be graffed in againe; as he tells us in the 26 <hi>ver: For this is my Covenant unto them;</hi> he lay's the foundation of all upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; they ſhall be gathered; why? its <hi>my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49133:31"/>with them. Now obſerve, this is a glorious peice of the worke, that that ſhall be the moſt excellent peice of the worke in the riſe of Chriſts kingdome, in the calling of the Jewes, its this, <hi>that it ſtands upon the new Covenant:</hi> The foote of Chriſts kingdome is bottomed upon the new Covenant, it was founded upon the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Eternitie; it was lodg'd in the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the firſt Promulgation of it to men; it was a peice of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> and when he tells us the worke of his kingdome ſhall riſe, he tells us it ſhall ariſe upon the foote of the Covenant: now lay all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and what can be more cleare than this, <hi>That the kingdome of Chriſt its a glorious peice of the new Covenant, its a branch of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, its ſuch a peice (as I told you before) as the Lord hath been pleaſed (in an eſpeciall manner, which he hath not done to any one branch of the new Covenant beſides it) to ſweare to, againe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and againe, and againe, that it ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſo,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> that the kingdome of Chriſt is lodg'd up in the new Covenant, that its founded there; Firſt, Wee may learne this, <hi>That let men or Satan doe what they can, for the cruſhing, and the keeping downe ſuch a thing, yet a day there is, when it will come forth, and that in the ſpite of all the power of men and hell;</hi> for its a peice of Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> and its a peice God hath <hi>ſworne to,</hi> and if the God of Heaven be able to make good his Oath, and performe his Covenant, and if he will not let his new Covenant that he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo highly of, his Everlaſting Covenant, that he hath laid the ſalvation of all his Children up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his own glory upon, if he will not let that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49133:32"/>fall, he muſt bring this thing to paſſe; therefore let men doe what they can, or let Satan do what he can, yet when that all the Power of Hell, and all the wiſdome of men, when it hath acted and put forth it ſelfe to the utmoſt, for the hindering ſuch a thing, that God who made this Covenant, and who keepes Covenant, and hath ſworne he will not alter the thing that is gone out of his lipps, and ſworne againe and againe, that he will make Chriſt higher than the kings of the Earth, this God will bring forth ſuch a thing, for his Covenant is a ſure Covenant, and an Everlaſting Covenant, and therefore indeed its not for us to ſtruggle againſt the will of God, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God; it good for us to waite upon God for his will in all things, ſo for this, the time for Gods bringing forth the kingdome of his Son, but for men to ſtruggle againſt this truth, when God brings it forth, men may undoe themſelves, becauſe its ſtriving againſt God, and one great branch of the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> If it be ſo that the kingdome of Chriſt is lodg'd up in the new Covenant, we may hence learne, <hi>That the unworthines of the Saints, it cannot, it ſhall not hinder or deprive them of this mercy:</hi> for new Covenant-mercy's they come riding over the head of all things that ſtand in the way, new Covenant Grace is a tryumphing Grace, its a Grace that rides in Triumph, what ever it meets with it rides over, its ſuch great Grace. Now this kingdome of Chriſt comes on upon the account of the new Covenant, and its the grace of the new Covenant, that ſhall uſher this kingdome into the world; and as this grace will bring it through all the oppoſitions of men
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49133:32"/>and Hell, ſo will it even come over the ſin and unworthines of the Saints, if ſo be that it were upon the account of the old Covenant, indeed we ſhould have little hope, Gods people in this day would have little hope. When I have many times in ſerious thoughts, lookt over the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints, all parties, it hath been a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcouragement, as touching the worke, than all the powers of the world, for upon the account of the old Covenant we are gone; to conſider the unworthynes of the Saints, its a harder thing to get over this, than to get over all other things, but conſider this is the ground of the worke, the new Covenant; if this kingdome were upon the old Covenant, I have oftentimes thought wee ſhould never have any hope, that ſuch a thing ſhould riſe up in the world, and though God might uſe another Generation, yet this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt dye, becauſe they have all broken Covenant with God: yet now ſeeing its riſing ground is upon the new Covenant, though the people of God are exceeding unworthy, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they may have mercy; and that ſoule that is moſt unworthy, yet he may come to be partaker of that bleſſednes of the new kingdome. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were going through the wilderneſs, and the Lord was dealing with them according to the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they murmured againſt God, and they all fell in the wilderneſſe; and ſo it would be with us in this day, if he dealt with us upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the old Covenant; but becauſe God deales with us upon the account of the new Covenant, as the people of God have cauſe to be humbled for all their ſinnes, yet conſider this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49133:33"/>cannot hinder, but the Lord can yet, and the Lord indeed I hope of his grace, will doe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things for his Children, notwithſtanding all their unworthines, his grace ſhall come tryumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all theſe. <hi>Davids</hi> kingdome grew out of the new Covenant, therefore it was not the unworthynes of him nor his followers that could hinder it from riſing. If you looke upon <hi>Sauls</hi> kingdome, it ſeemes to be glorious at firſt; but afterwards, becauſe it was not founded on the new Covenant, it grew worſe and worſe; <hi>Saul</hi> at firſt ſeem'd to have much faith and ſelfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, when the Lot fell upon him, and they were commanded to bring him forth to crowne him King, <hi>he hid himſelfe,</hi> that they were forc't to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Lord to know where he was: and when the Children of <hi>Belial</hi> ſaid, <hi>How ſhall this man ſave us, they deſpis'd him, and brought him no preſents, but he held his peace,</hi> in the 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 9.27. he ſeem'd to be ſo patient and ſo humble, as if he tooke no notice of it: ſo in the 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 11.12, 13. there you ſhall finde, after they had gotten a great victory over the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and ſome of the people <hi>ſaid unto Samuel, who is he that ſayd, ſhall Saul reigne over us? bring the men that we may put them to death: And Saul ſaid, There ſhall not a man be put to death this day; for to day the Lord hath wrought Salvation in Iſrael.</hi> As if <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould have ſaid, I will never give way to paſſion and rage, why? the Lord hath wrought glorious Salvation in <hi>Iſrael</hi> this day, the Lord with his Salvation hath been among us, and by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Salvation hath delivered us; his heart ſeemes to be wonderfully taken with the deliverance: but afterwards, looke upon <hi>Sauls</hi> kingdome, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49133:33"/>its ſtill waneing, and decaying more and more; and why? becauſe it was founded upon the old Covenant. But looke upon <hi>Davids</hi> kingdome, and you ſhall ſee in the beginning of it, it did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe through many faylings and infirmities, that were both in <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, and his followers; <hi>David</hi> he runs away from <hi>Saul,</hi> goes to <hi>Ahime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> the Prieſt, and tells a lye to get ſome bread, and <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword; afterward he runs to <hi>Achiſh</hi> king of <hi>Gath,</hi> and fain's himſelfe mad: and when he had been invading the Countrey neere unto him where he dwelt (at <hi>Zicklag</hi>) and <hi>Achiſh</hi> asked him whether he had made his rode that day, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 27.10. <hi>David</hi> tells him a flat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, that they had been <hi>againſt the South of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah:</hi> At another time, he fail'd exceedingly, when in a way of revengefull rage he would goe againſt <hi>Naball,</hi> to cut him off and all his houſe, for denying him proviſion; theſe were ſtairing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, men (no doubt) did wonder what would become of <hi>David</hi> &amp; his caſe, that was attended with ſo many weakneſſes and offences; And look upon his followers, and ſee what a rabble-rout he had at firſt, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 22.1. <hi>When David was eſcaped to the Cave Adullam, then, every one that was in diſtreſſe, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was diſcontented, gathered themſelves unto him, and he became a Captaine over them;</hi> if one ſhould ſeriouſly looke upon <hi>David</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, would be thinke there ſhould any good come of it? many no doubt did thus looke upon <hi>David</hi> and his followers, and therefore expected no good to come of his kingdome. I bring it to this end to ſhew, that though men may have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many infirmities and weakneſſes, yet if the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49133:34"/>worke ariſe through the new Covenant, it ſhall goe on with a notwithſtanding: <hi>Davids</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was founded upon the new Covenant, and therefore it was carryed on, through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and weakneſſes; and <hi>Sauls</hi> kingdome aroſe onely out of the Covenant of workes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though it had a glorious beginning) it did waſt away. Therefore let not the hearts of Gods people faint or be diſcouraged, though there are groſſe failings among the Saints, and in thoſe too that deſire to be friends to <hi>Davids</hi> kingdome, though there be much of paſſion and the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of men in them: Conſider, Chriſts viſible kingdome in this world ſtands upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Covenant, it did help <hi>David</hi> to the kingdome, though through many Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I ſpeake not this, to Indulge any infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Gods Children, I deſire that this glorious cauſe might be ſo mannaged, as it deſerves; yet ſuppoſe its mannaged with many infirmities, ſo that many ſtumble at it, ſaying, Can this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy ever proſper? Let ſuch conſider that this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bleſſed cauſe is founded upon the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and though men cannot over-looke In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, yet God will, and accompliſh the thing notwithſtanding them for the new Covenants ſake, <hi>I will be mercifull to their ſins, and remember their Iniquities no more.</hi> Conſider, when Jeſus Chriſt rid to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as a King, he did not chooſe the moſt glorious Beaſt to ride upon, but he choſe that Beaſt that was moſt weake, contemptible and ſimple, ſo now the Lord he chooſeth <hi>weake things to confound the ſtrong, and fooliſh things to confound the wiſe.</hi> Wee have a good cauſe, and we are upon a good ground,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49133:34"/>we are upon the new Teſtament ground; and ſeeing its founded upon the new Covenant, the grace of the Covenant will tryumph over all the weakneſſes and infirmities of the Saints that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to carry it on: the Lord makes uſe of the weakneſſes of his people ſometimes, to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blind, and to ſtumble, to be a rocke of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but when the worke is done, all their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſaith the Lord ſhall be forgotten; the Lord will come and ſwallow up all in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: as <hi>Davids</hi> weakneſſes, were a ſtumbling blocke to thoſe that lived in his age, and when the Lord had ſtumbled all in that age and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then he makes his worke to ariſe higher and higher, through the grace of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and ſo it will be with the viſible Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe its founded on the new Covenant, which is a ſure and an Everlaſting Covenant; he hath made <hi>with me an Everlaſting Covenant, ordered and ſure:</hi> the Lord hath found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſo ſure, that all the Devills in Hell, and all the rage of men in the world, cannot hinder it, <hi>Though my houſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>David be not ſo with God, yet he hath made an Everlaſting Covenant with me, which ſhall ſtand;</hi> though the Saints doe not grow in grace, yet this glorious worke of Chriſts kingdome, which is founded upon the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, muſt goe on: the Houſe that is builded upon the rocke, though the winds blow, and floods ariſe, and beate upon the Houſe, it ſtands faſt, becauſe its built upon the rocke; ſo, Chriſts kingdome it hath a rocky foundation, its founded upon the Covenant of God, that is, an Impregnable rocke; its ſuch a foundation that all the world cannot hurt, if any come and ſtrike
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49133:35"/>at it, it will grind them to powder; this is a ſweet conſideration, and ſhould provoke us to looke up to God, for the accompliſhing of this great mercy; and to looke unto him for new mercy's, Gods people ſtand for nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this kingdome, but God will make the world one day know, it was a peice of the new Covenant. The unworthynes of the Saints ſhall not hinder them of this mercy, for new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Grace will ride Tryumphing over the head of all the Infirmities of the people of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Another thing (if it be a mercy lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up in the new Covenant) we may learne hence is, <hi>That it is not ſtrange, or it ought not to be ſtrange to us, if we ſhould ſee a death upon this worke, if we ſhould ſee this worke ſtruck dead, when it may be it ſeemes to be coming forth;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed its Gods way in bringing forth mercy's of the new Covenant, to ſtrike the mercy dead. <hi>Abraham</hi> had two ſons, the ſon of <hi>Hagar</hi> the old Covenant, and the ſon of <hi>Sarah</hi> the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; there's no death comes upon <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the old Covenant, but there comes a death (<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> body is dead, and <hi>Sarah's</hi> wombe is dead) upon <hi>Iſaac</hi> the new Covenant, the new Covenant mercy is ſtruck dead, ſo when the Lord will ſet up his Son as King, he will doe it upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the new Covenant, therefore we muſt expect this new covenant mercy to paſſe through death, ſo that God ſtrikes the new Covenant mercy dead, before he brings it forth. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they come out upon the account of the new Covenant, God remembers his Covenant and ſends <hi>Moſes</hi> to them, thereupon they are full of expectation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49133:35"/>of deliverance, but preſently their burdens were encreaſed, and their oppreſſion encreaſed, and thereupon all is ſtruck dead, and they are further from deliverance than ever they were, and yet notwithſtanding when God had tryed but a while their faith and patience, (for that is the end of all his bringing deaths upon a worke, to try our faith and patience, but) ſo ſoone as ever that was tryed, then the Lord brings them forth by his glorious hand. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> God had promiſed him the kingdome, yet there was a wonderfull death came upon <hi>Davids</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>David</hi> is made a king, and ſome few come to him, and <hi>David</hi> had ſome faith, when <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt came to him when he fled from <hi>Saul,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Abide with me, and thou ſhalt be ſafe, for with me there's ſafety,</hi> but when his kingdome is juſt ready to come to him, there comes a great ſentence of death upon the worke, becauſe its a new Covenant worke, all is ſtruck dead, <hi>I ſhall certainly periſh one day by the hand of Saul, and I muſt leave the Country, ſaith David,</hi> ſo its with all new Covenant mercy's, that the Lord might try the faith of his Children, which he will have tryed, and that he might make the mercy the ſweeter when it comes, and that we might be more in crying to him: God ſtrikes the worke dead, that we might exerciſe the more faith and prayer, therefore let us not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, when we ſee a ſentence of death upon it, it would be a great diſcouragement to me, if there were not a Sentence of death upon it, I ſhould beleive then it were a greater way off than it is; <hi>for if it be a new Covenant mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, there muſt be a Sentence of Death put upon it.</hi> As in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49133:36"/>mercy's to a particular ſoule, God will have the ſoule ſtrucke dead, before the Lord reveale the new Covenant mercy to him, that the ſoule ſhall ſay, I can ſee nothing, I have nothing at all; it can ſee no wiſdome, no righteouſneſſe, nothing in it ſelfe, and when all is ſtrucke dead, then the Lord comes with new Covenant mercy's to the ſoule; ſo, when the Lord intends to ſet up his Sonnes kingdome in the earth, it muſt firſt be wholly ſtruck dead.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> If this kingdome of Chriſt be a mercy lodged up in the new Covenant, then <hi>wee ſhould waite upon God patiently for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it forth:</hi> New Covenant mercy's they are to be waited for: <hi>Abraham</hi> loſt himſelfe greatly in murmuring, while he was waiting for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the new Covenant promiſe, he cryes out, <hi>I goe Childleſſe,</hi> he had a promiſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees it not fulfilled, he cry's, <hi>I goe child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and this Eleazar of Damaſcus, who is Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of my houſe, muſt be my heire:</hi> and what doth this his repining bring forth? why preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very next thing we read, is <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sahah</hi> diſtruſting God, lay their heads together, and upon advice, he goe's in <hi>Hagar,</hi> (he turnes into the old Covenant) and had fruit by her, and there <hi>Abraham</hi> reſts and ſettles himſelfe ſome yeares; he goes and turnes into the old Covenant by an Impatient waiting for the new Covenant; we are not to waite as Idlers doe for helpe in a ditch, and cry God helpe us, but we are to wait as if we would have it in by our very ſtriving &amp; ſtrugling, yet notwithſtanding there muſt be a quiet waiting on God for his time, ſo it ſhould be with us, for this new Covenant mercy;

            <p>And is it a new Covenant mercy,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>5</label> 
               <hi>this will be a ſweet mercy when it comes, all the new Covenant mercy's are ſweete things;</hi> what ever the world thinke of Chriſts kingdome, when it comes it will be a ſweet thing; that the Saints ſhall have glory hereafter, doth that hinder the ſpirituall enjoyment of God here? ſo, the outward king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, what will that hinder the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enjoyment of Chriſt? But the Devill play's his game thus in the new Teſtament Times, he made men to looke for an outward kingdome onely, when Chriſt was about to ſet up a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all kingdome; and now that Chriſt would ſet up an outward kingdome, ſaith the Devill looke onely to the ſpirituall kingdome, as if the our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpirituall kingdome could not ſtand together, as if the glory of the body's and ſoules of the Saints could not ſtand together.</p>
            <p>And then againe,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>6</label> If it be a new Covenant mercy, <hi>it will be a ſpirituall thing; though ſome
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49133:37"/>may call it a carnall and a low thing, yet it will be a ſpirituall thing:</hi> the Lord teach us to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to looke up to him, to truſt in him, to relye on him, for there ſhall be a day of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; our worke is to waite; ſeeke, pray, and waite in theſe day's; the Lord teach his people to goe along with him; as the little Children at his entrance into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> cryed <hi>Hoſanna, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna;</hi> he rides upon a poore meane creature, the foale of an Aſſe, and the Children follow him crying <hi>Hoſanna, Hoſanna;</hi> ſo we ſhould eye the Lord Jeſus now in the meaneſt appearances, and follow him crying <hi>Hoſanna in the Higheſt,</hi> this we ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>The Lord make us waite on him for his owne Time, and that time is not farre off, I cannot thinke its farre off; becauſe many thinke it a great way off, its an argument to me its neare, for God comes upon his people when he finds not faith on Earth, when Gods people ſay its farre off, then its neare; as, when God ſent <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to tell the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Lord would deliver them, but before deliverance, theſentence of death comes, and O ſay they to <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> what have you brought us to? where is their faith now, expecting deliverance at the hand of God? Now it was worſe with them than before, and their bondage is encreaſed, and their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was thought further off: O but then was the Lords time, he Immediatly brought it to paſſe; then was the Lords time come, when their faith was gone. So when <hi>David</hi> ſtood up firſt upon the account of his kingdome, ſaith he, to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> Come with me and thou ſhalt be ſafe, I am ſure God will give me the kingdome;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49133:37"/>though <hi>Saul</hi> be a Potent Enemy, and mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies many, yet I am ſure God will give me the kingdome; but yet, after that, when <hi>Saul</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him that he was forc't to fly out of one Hole into another, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall I periſh one day by the hand of Saul;</hi> then, when he thought it thus farre off, then the kingdome comes forth, the hand of the Lord cutts off <hi>Saul,</hi> and the kingdome Immediately comes to <hi>David.</hi> As when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they thought they ſhould have all things, then <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> built, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all things; but when they were about it, building the Temple, now a ſtop is put upon the worke, and they cry, <hi>The time is not for the Lords worke yet,</hi> till that <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> tells them, <hi>Now is the Time for building the Lords Temple:</hi> As it is with private Chriſtians in a doubting houre, Saints uſually conclude, we are too forward for that time; obſerve, <hi>Then is Gods time;</hi> they had faith at firſt, and after their faith fayles from the worke, and they ſaid, <hi>it was not time;</hi> mark, <hi>then was the time,</hi> the Lord ſends <hi>Haggai</hi> to tell them, they liv'd in their Ceiled Houſes, and neglected Gods houſe, O now was the time when they thought not of it; And juſt ſo, when Chriſt ſuffered on the Croſſe, <hi>We thought,</hi> ſay the Diſciples, <hi>this was he that ſhould have delivered us,</hi> their hope was gone of any deliverance by him, yet then was their Redemption at hand, their Redemption comes forth Immediatly, he finiſhes the worke of Redemption at that time; ſo that to have faith ſtruck dead, is not an Evidence that the worke ſtands a great way off, but that its neare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49133:38"/>and approaching: ſurely the Lord will come forth in his Time, and he is not farre from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome great and glorious thing in the world; Gods peoples faith is not grounded upon fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, but they ſee and know that God is doing ſome glorious thing in the world, he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning kingdomes, and ſetting up the kingdome of his Son; O that we could quietly looke up unto the Lord, and waite upon the Lord, <hi>Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with Trembling, kiſſe the Son leſt he be angry</hi> yee great ones of the Earth, <hi>leſt his wrath be kindled;</hi> and you that follow the Lord, O doe you <hi>rejoyce with feare, and ſerve him with Trembling;</hi> they that ſtand may fall; O when was there ſuch a falling as now ſhall be, when the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to ſhake terribly the earth;</hi> no Hiſtory can paralel ſuch ſhakings as have been in theſe laſt dayes, therefore we had need take heed leſt we fall, and looke up to the Lord that we may ſtand: Indeed its a bleſſed truth, what ever men may thinke of it, ſo ſure as my hand is upon this Bible, ſo ſure ſhall ſuch a thing come forth in due time; for as this is the true word of God, of a true God that cannot lye, ſo certainly it ſhall come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>I have onely inſiſted on one particular, <hi>the kingdome as a Branch of the new Covenant,</hi> but to ſpeake of the kingdome as its held forth in the Word, would take up a large time, for there's not any one truth hath more to be ſaid from the Scripture for it, than this, <hi>of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> for as the end of all is Gods glory, ſo, this is that, concerns Chriſts glory, there's a vane

            <p>Firſt, There was a great and wonderfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the power and majeſty of God, when the Lord was to <hi>deliver Iſrael out of Egypt,</hi> and that was a remarkable time, a time that God had mark't out, 430 yeares; <hi>At the end of</hi> 430 <hi>yeares, all the hoſt of the Lord,</hi> its ſaid, <hi>came out of the Land of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, At the time of <hi>Iſraels coming out of Babylon;</hi> There was a glorious appearance of God, in ſtirring up the heart of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to make him ſo forward and ready of his own accord, to put on the worke of God, of building the Temple, and make Proclamation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49133:40"/>throughout all his Dominions, to the Jewes, to goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to doe this worke; here was a great hand of God: now this time was alſo mark't out, ſeventy yeares <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and then to come forth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The time <hi>of our Lords firſt Coming,</hi> it was a time wherein there was a glorious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of God, God now manifeſts himſelfe in the fleſh, as the Apoſtle tells us; now, what remarkable ſignes were ſet upon this time? there were three remarkable ſignes ſet upon this time, by either of which this Generation, might have knowne or diſcerned Jeſus Chriſt to be the True Meſſiah.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There was at this time <hi>the departure of the Scepter from Judah,</hi> Propheſied of by <hi>Jacob,</hi> as you may find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his feete, untill Shiloh come:</hi> that is, untill Chriſt come: ſo that whenſoever the Scepter was taken away from <hi>Judah,</hi> they might then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, now will the Meſſiah come, now is he in the world, whether we ſee him or no, yet he is come, for the Scepter was not to depart till he was come: now its obſervable, that at this very time the Scepter <hi>was</hi> taken away, for this <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> that was now king in <hi>Judea,</hi> he was a ſtranger, and not of the blood of the Jewes, an <hi>Idumean;</hi> and he was the firſt ſtranger that ever was King over the people of the Jewes, for they had alwayes ſome of their own nation ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, but now there was a ſtranger ſwaying the Scepter among them at this time; ſo that here was an Evident fulfilling of the ſigne of the time; at this time the Scepter was gone, ſo they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49133:41"/>might well have concluded the Meſſiah was come from <hi>Jacobs</hi> Propheſie, that Jeſus was the Meſſiah, for he comes at the very ſame time that the Scepter departed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was another remarkable ſigne of the Time, and that was, <hi>The Expiring or ending of Daniels ſeventy weekes,</hi> its foretold to <hi>Daniel</hi> that ſeventy weekes ſhould be the tearme of time unto the Meſſiah's appearance, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Seventy weekes are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy City, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for Iniquitie, and to bring in Everlaſting righteouſneſſe, and to ſeale up the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Propheſie, and to anoint the moſt holy.</hi> Seventy weekes was the determined time of Chriſts coming; that is, from the time the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel here ſpeakes theſe words, ſeventy weekes, or foure hundred and ninety yeares, reckoning ſo many dayes as there are in ſo many weekes, for that indeed is the Holy-Ghoſts way of account; now it was cleare enough, that the ſeventy weekes muſt be either expired, or very neare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring about that time; and therefore that was another great ſigne of the Time, that the Lord Jeſus came and declared himſelfe to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiab, about that time that <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſoretold the Meſſiah was to come forth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There was another Evident ſigne of this time, and that was, <hi>Chriſts doing of thoſe things that were foretold ſhould be accompliſhed by the Meſſiah, and that in the day of his appearance,</hi> as, Chriſts opening the eyes of the blind, the eares of the deafe, cauſing the lame to walke; in the 11th of <hi>Math: The lame walke, the dumb ſpeake,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49133:41"/>the dead are raiſed, the Lepers are cleanſed, and the poore receive the Goſpel;</hi> Here were the ſignes of the Times. It was foretold by the Prophets, that when the Meſſiah came, theſe things ſhould be done, now they ſaw theſe things done; Jeſus Chriſt comes and doth theſe very workes and miracles that they expected ſhould be done by the Meſſiah, therefore this was a very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſigne of the Time, that Jeſus Chriſt was the Meſſiah, and therefore Jeſus Chriſt labours to convince <hi>John</hi> by theſe ſignes of the Times. But then</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The time <hi>of Chirſts ſecond coming,</hi> that ſhalbe another time wherein the Lord will moſt gloriouſly appeare and manifeſt himſelfe; now that time alſo hath moſt evident and remarkable ſignes ſet upon it, and that by the Lord and his Word. If we looke into the 24 of <hi>Mathew,</hi> we ſhall find many of the ſignes of this day; I ſhall touch upon ſome few, in the 10 verſe, <hi>Many ſhall be offended, and ſhall betray one another, and ſhall hate one another;</hi> there's one ſigne of that time, many offended at the wayes and people and truth of God, hate one another, and betray one another. Againe, <hi>Iniquitie ſhall abound,</hi> (verſ. 12.) <hi>and the love of many ſhall wax cold;</hi> many ſhall fall away.

O, there was their owne <hi>Intereſt,</hi> they had all the honour, and all the credit, eſteeme and reputation, the people cry'd them up as the onely men, and now they ſaw if they ſhould owne Jeſus Chriſt, their honour was gone, and their <hi>Intereſt</hi> would be loſt, and that blinds them, that they could not ſee <hi>the ſignes of the Times:</hi> there's nothing blinds a man ſo as <hi>his Intereſt</hi> doth, if his heart be glued to his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and ſet upon it, I will have my <hi>Intereſt,</hi> let light be never ſo cleare, and ſignes be never ſo evident, a man that ſets up his <hi>owne Intereſt,</hi> he will never diſcerne nor take notice of the <hi>ſignes</hi> of the times; If there be any thing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49133:44"/>that blinds men that they cannot fee <hi>the ſignes</hi> of the times at this day, I am perſwaded this is one thing, <hi>the Intereſts of men,</hi> of this ſort of men, and the other ſort of men, they have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> that runs croſſe to that which is held forth by the <hi>ſignes</hi> of the times, that ought to be done, if this be done (ſay they) our <hi>Intereſt</hi> will downe, this muſt downe that I have ſo much ſet my heart upon, therefore they will not owne <hi>the ſignes of the times,</hi> this blinds men that they cannot ſee the <hi>ſignes</hi> of the Times.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>When they have an Envie;</hi> there's a ſecret envie in the hearts of men againſt this or the other perſon, or, this or the other party; if ſo be things ſhould come forth, as they are held forth in the <hi>ſignes of the times,</hi> they ſee ſuch and ſuch men will be equall with them, or above them, and that they cannot bare; this was very evident in this generation of men the Scribes and Phariſees, they had a cleare diſcerning that if ſo be they ſhould have come and owned things as they were held forth in the <hi>ſignes of the Times,</hi> and owned Jeſus Chriſt for the Meſſiah, the Lord Jeſus muſt be ſet up above them; they could not endure that the Lord Jeſus ſhould be ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, for they envyed him in their hearts, they had drunk in a praejudice againſt him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not endure that Chriſt ſhould come and ſit above them, and hence they could not ſee the <hi>ſignes</hi> of the times; and indeed this was a thing ſo viſible, that <hi>Pilate,</hi> a Heathen, could diſcerne it; <hi>he knew that for envie they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him,</hi> that what they did to Chriſt was from their envie more than their zeale; ſo, men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne if things goe on as they are pointed at in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49133:45"/>the <hi>ſignes</hi> of the times, (they feare) thoſe they envie will come to be equall with them, and the like; if it were not for mens <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and mens <hi>envie,</hi> one man at another, they could and would ſee more of the <hi>ſignes of the Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>When that there is a heart in men that is gone, that is backſlidden and departed from the worke of God in the time, that is that that doth blind men that they cannot ſee the ſignes of the times;</hi> and ſo indeed it was in this Generation, our Lord ſaith to them that they were a wicked and an adulterous Generation, <hi>a wicked and an adulterous Generation ſeeke after a ſigne,</hi> they were a generation of men that were gone from the work of God, adulterated from the work of God, they were ſo backſlidden from it that now they had no heart, they had no love to it; they had ſet their love upon others, and their hearts were not upon God, and upon his glory, and upon his cauſe, &amp; inſtead of ſeeking <hi>the ſignes of the times,</hi> they ſeeke after other <hi>ſignes,</hi> as it is with back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding hearts, they will endeavour all they can to ſhift off all conviction; its ſaid, <hi>they came to Chriſt tempting him and deſiring him to ſhew them a ſigne from heaven;</hi> Wherein lay this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? it lay as I conceive in this, in that they came in a ſecret and ſubtill deſigne, pretending they deſired much to be ſatisfied that he was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and yet notwithſtanding they had a ſubtill deſigne to ſhift off all conviction; for indeed <hi>the ſignes of the times</hi> they were ſo manifeſt, they did ſtaire ſo fully in the face of this Generation, and they did make their conſciences ſo bare and naked, that thay were many times troubled with Throbs and Check's, O this is the Meſſiah, this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49133:45"/>is the Chriſt, ſo that now they come to ſtill their conſciences, in a ſubtill way they labour to ſhift off all conviction; they ſay, <hi>Lord ſhew us a ſigne,</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, Lord we would be willing to receive and owne thee as the Meſſiah, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo farre to us as to ſhew us a ſigne; though they had experience time after time, Chriſt would not condeſcend to them in their flattering hypocriticall way; they would ſay, the Meſſiah is meeke and humble, we will aske a ſigne, if he will not give it us, he is proud, he is not the Chriſt, and this they thought would eaſe their conſciences; for they had ſtrong co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>icti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though they laboured to evade them; now Chriſt ſeeing they came in this hypocriticall way, he anſwers them, <hi>Can yee not ſee the ſignes of the times?</hi> he caught them in their ſubtilty and hypocriſie, tempting of him, therefore he preſſes the more upon them, <hi>Can yee not diſcerne the ſignes of the times?</hi> He takes the <hi>ſignes</hi> of the times and makes them lye more cloſe upon their Conſciences: Chriſt would not yeeld to them to give them ſuch <hi>a ſigne</hi> as they would have, but puts them upon <hi>the ſignes of the times,</hi> to conſider them; and if Chriſt ſhould have given them <hi>a new particular ſigne,</hi> they would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived it, if they would not be convinc't by <hi>the ſignes of the times:</hi> as it is in the Parable of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in the 15 of <hi>Luke, They have Moſes and the Prophets</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they will not believe them, ſo neither will they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive if one ſhould goe from the dead to them.</hi> Chriſt goes downe into the grave and riſes againe after three dayes, there they had <hi>a new ſigne,</hi> and yet they would not own this neither, but hire others
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49133:46"/>to keepe off the knowledge of it from the world by telling of a lye. Now when light breakes in upon men, to require <hi>a ſigne,</hi> that is, another light than the <hi>ſignes of the times,</hi> its hypocriſie, to ſhift off the light that men have; therefore Chriſt calls them <hi>an hypocriticall Generation,</hi> whoſe hearts were not real to the worke &amp; cauſe of God; when God clearely appeares among us in his workes, and in ſundry <hi>ſignes,</hi> then for men to call for <hi>other ſignes</hi> its provoking: Chriſt doth give them a ſigne, <hi>There ſhall be no ſigne given this evill and adulterous Generation, but the ſigne of the Prophet Jonas;</hi> what <hi>ſigne</hi> was that? he gives them <hi>ſuch a ſigne,</hi> that they ſhould never ſee the <hi>ſigne,</hi> till the worke was over; they could conclude nothing from it till it was too late; <hi>As Jonas was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly, ſo ſhall the Son of man be three dayes and three nights in the belly of the earth,</hi> they could gather nothing from this ſigne till Chriſt was dead and riſen againe, and then the worke was over, &amp; they had fild up the meaſure of their Iniquitie; and ſo they could gather nothing from <hi>this ſigne,</hi> till it was too late; therefore its bad dallying with, and tempting of the Lord; Chriſt gives theſe perſons <hi>a ſigne</hi> for the hardening of them, <hi>a ſigne</hi> in Judgement, <hi>a ſigne</hi> that ſhould not open their eyes till it was too late, therefore take heed of ſhifting off <hi>the ſignes of the times;</hi> take heed againſt <hi>cleare ſignes,</hi> to ſhuffle off Gods worke, ſaying, I muſt have <hi>ſome other ſigne,</hi> or ſome <hi>extraordinary ſigne,</hi> God will not be dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in ſuch things as theſe are.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49133:47"/>ſhould be <hi>the worke of the preſent time;</hi> and what the worke is, that the Saints and people of God are called to, if the diſpenſations of God doe not call to this, and if the word of God doth not leade them to this, if all doth not leade us to this, namely, <hi>To looke upon the worke of Chriſts viſible kingdome in the world.</hi> Satan that is indeed the grand Enemie of the kingdome of our Lord Jeſus, he doth labour (as you may have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) might and maine, ſo long as he could, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſcure the notion it ſelfe of <hi>a viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and indeed, to hold the Saints and people of God, in ſuch a beleife, as that there was no ſuch thing at all as <hi>an outward kingdome,</hi> but it was a phanſie and a dreame of thoſe who ever they were that did expect it; and truly, it was none of the leſt of the ſubtilties of the Serpent, in ſetting abroach thoſe principles of late yeares among profeſſors, that all things were to be taken <hi>ſpiritually;</hi> and ſo indeed make them to allegorize the whole Scripture, knowing that could he once bring them to this, he ſhould thereby keepe downe <hi>the kingdome,</hi> which he did clearely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee was neere approaching, and would riſe in the world; but when the Devill ſaw that his pollicy fayl'd him here, and that indeed there was ſuch a bleſſed light of <hi>this viſible kingdome</hi> let forth into the world, that all thoſe miſts that he rais'd could not darken the light of it, why truly (as I have feared others doe) he fly's to this retreate as to another hole, out of which he might beate downe the preſent worke of the Generation, namely this, to perſwade the hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and to make us all be of a beleife, that there is no ſuch thing that Saints ſhould
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49133:47"/>looke for, or expect, or attend unto, <hi>as a viſible kingdome,</hi> untill the day of Chriſts appearance; and truly if ſo be the Devill can but accompliſh his end and deſigne here, if he can but bring us to the beleife of ſuch a thing as this, he doth know full well, that he ſhall as effectually oppoſe and ſtrike dead the preſent worke of the generation, as ever he could have done if he had held the people of God in the beleife of the other thing, that there is no fift kingdome at all; for what are Saints called to, or can they doe, unleſſe it be onely to pray and to beleive, which Saints of all ages and generations from the beginning of the world might doe? I ſay, what in this age are they in an eſpeciall manner called to, in reference to Chriſts kingdome, if ſo be there be not ſuch a thing till Chriſt appeare? I deſire to ſpeake this ſoberly, becauſe indeed I could not wave it.</p>
            <p>I thought to have fallen directly upon <hi>the ſignes of the Times,</hi> and not to have ſpoken any thing as to the thing it ſelfe, but truly all <hi>ſignes</hi> will be of little uſe, if the thing it ſelfe be in doubt; therefore I ſaw a neceſſity that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be ſpoken unto that; To cleare therefore the conceptions of the people of God in this, and that we may goe upon as cleare ground as may be, let it be conſidered,</p>
            <p>Aſſer: <hi>That the kingdome of Chriſt, his viſible kingdome, or that thing called the fift Monarchy, its twofold, or it doth conſiſt of two parts, namely, the kingdome of the Stone, and the kingdome of the Mountaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe I conceive to <hi>be as the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time of that kingdome,</hi> to wit, all that time that is to be, before the riſing of the morning

            <p>The firſt of theſe, it is (as I may ſo ſay) <hi>the working kingdome of the Saints,</hi> its that kingdome wherein Saints are by their Lord Imployed to doe ſome notable ſervice againſt his coming; which is, <hi>The breaking downe the great Image, the bringing downe all his Enemies,</hi> that when he comes he may find them his footſtoole, for he is to ſit at the fathers right hand untill all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be made his footſtoole; therefore this <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Stone</hi> is the working kingdome, the kingdome wherein the Saints are Imployed in a glorious worke for Chriſt, to plucke downe all, that Jeſus Chriſt when he comes may have his Enemies his footſtoole.</p>
            <p>The other I call <hi>the kingdome of glory,</hi> wherein the Saints ſhall not ſo properly worke, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; they ſhall in that kingdome, <hi>the kingdome of the Mountaine,</hi> be glorified with Chriſt, and receive the reward of their workes.</p>

            <p> This twofold ſtate of Chriſts kingdome, we have reſembled and ſet forth by a double Type, <hi>Davids kingdome</hi> was a Type of the firſt, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> of the ſecond; <hi>Davids kingdome</hi> was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Type of the <hi>kingdome of the Stone,</hi> and therefore it roſe by the <hi>hand of God alone,</hi> in a wonderfull way; a company of poore men come to him, and all the world is againſt him; and the worke is low at firſt, it creepes up by little and little; and <hi>Davids</hi> puts downe all his Enemies round about, as the <hi>Midianites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> &amp;c. and makes them all ſtoope to him at laſt: This was <hi>the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring kingdome,</hi> a kingdome wherein there was blood. <hi>Solomons kingdome,</hi> was a Type of <hi>the kingdome of the Mountaine,</hi> wherein was peace. Therefore the 72 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> wherein is deſcribed the glory of this kingdome, its entitled <hi>a Pſalme for Solomon,</hi> ſo that <hi>Solomons</hi> kingdome was a Type of the ſecond.</p>
            <p>This <hi>diſtinction</hi> likewiſe is warranted, by that <hi>diſtinction</hi> that we find in <hi>Daniel</hi> of his myſticall numbers, looke into the laſt of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and you ſhall find two ſorts of numbers, 1290 dayes, and 1335 dayes, <hi>Dan:</hi> 12.12, 13. <hi>And from the time that the dayly ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh deſolate ſet up, there ſhall be</hi> 1290 <hi>day's: Bleſſed is he that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and cometh to the</hi> 1335 <hi>dayes.</hi> The firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1290 dayes, points us to that time where <hi>the kingdome of the Stone begins, as it is the Stone of Iſrael.</hi> Obſerve that, for <hi>Daniel</hi> is now ſpeaking of his owne people, ſo its the Stone of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> calls it in his bleſſing of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> there ſhall a bleſſed Stone riſe among the Jewes; now as its

Firſt, there is the time wherein the Dominion <hi>begins</hi> to be taken away, then there's a day of <hi>Conſumption,</hi> and then there comes <hi>the end,</hi> and a turning of all worldly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into the hands of the Saints, <hi>The kingdome and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdome under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high;</hi> But I ſay, there is a <hi>beginning</hi> of this worke where they take away his Dominion, there <hi>begins the kingdome of the Stone; When the kingdome and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdome under the whole heaven, comes into the hands of the Saints,</hi> there begins the kingdome of the Mountain. Now this Truth I am ſpeaking of, or this twofold conſideration of the fift kingdome, indeed its a thing of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that we cannot rightly apply the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>fift Monarchy</hi> without the knowledge of it; its not a phanſie or a dreame, but truly I looke upon it as being a maine and a principall part of that faith once delivered to the Saints, as touching the <hi>fift kingdome;</hi> and the rather I
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49133:49"/>ſpeake of it, becauſe I finde divers good men writing of this <hi>fift kingdome,</hi> wholly paſſe over the <hi>kingdome of the Stone,</hi> and inſiſt wholly upon <hi>the kingdome of the Mountaine,</hi> as if the <hi>kingdome of the Stone</hi> did not belong to the <hi>fift Monarchy.</hi> Now that this <hi>kingdome of the Stone,</hi> is a part, and a principall part of the <hi>fift Monarchy,</hi> is cleare and Evident, from <hi>Dan:</hi> 2.44. <hi>And in the dayes of thoſe kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdome, which ſhall never be deſtroyed; and the kingdome ſhall not be left to other people, but it ſhall breake in peices, and conſume all theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever. In the dayes of thoſe kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> What is this <hi>Daniel</hi> calls <hi>a kingdome</hi> here, and the <hi>God of heavens kingdome?</hi> its no other but the <hi>little Stone, Daniel</hi> had been Interpreting all the parts of the <hi>great Image,</hi> and coming to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>the Stone</hi> (having not ſpoken of that yet) he calls it <hi>a kingdome,</hi> and <hi>a kingdome of the God of heaven;</hi> therefore <hi>the Stone</hi> ſhall be a different kingdome from all the kingdomes of this world, for its call'd <hi>the kingdome of the God of heaven,</hi> in oppoſition to all the kingdomes of this world, of the <hi>great Image</hi> ſpoken of before: and its ſuch a kingdome as ſhall <hi>never be deſtroyed, nor left to other people, but ſhall breake in peices and conſume all the other kingdomes.</hi> Now what is that break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peice, but <hi>the Stone?</hi> now <hi>this Stone,</hi> this kingdome, is called <hi>a kingdome that ſhall never be deſtroyed:</hi> now what is that that ſhall never be deſtroyed by any Enemie, but the <hi>fift Monarchy?</hi> therefore the <hi>kingdome of the Stone</hi> muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be conſidered as the <hi>fift Monarchy,</hi> or as one maine peice of it: And though this <hi>Stone</hi> funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49133:50"/>is <hi>Chriſt himſelfe,</hi> yet conſidered as <hi>ſmiting</hi> the <hi>great Image,</hi> it can be no other but <hi>Chriſt Myſticall,</hi> Chriſt in his Members; and the <hi>cutting out</hi> of <hi>this Stone</hi> cannot be meant, as ſome would have it, of <hi>Chriſts firſt Coming,</hi> for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the kingdome of the Stone it doth ariſe in the dayes of the ten Antichriſtian kings; and in the dayes of theſe kings ſhall the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſet up a kingdome.</hi> What kings are theſe? theſe kings are not the <hi>foure Monarchy's,</hi> for the kingdome of God was not ſet up in the time of thoſe Monarchy's, but in the fourth and laſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and here is ſpoken of kings in the plurall number, <hi>In the dayes of thoſe kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdome;</hi> thoſe kings therefore are the <hi>ten Antichriſtian kings,</hi> which are ſet forth by <hi>ten toes,</hi> where the worke begins, and the firſt ſtroake is ſtrucke; and are called the <hi>ten Hornes</hi> in another place; and in <hi>Dan:</hi> 7. thoſe <hi>ten Hornes</hi> are interpreted <hi>ten kings,</hi> and in the time of thoſe kings the Stone is cut out, they are the ten Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian kings; and if ſo, the Stone cannot be ſo early cut out, as the birth of Chriſt, for that was long before the ten Antichriſtian kings had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or exiſtence in the world, therefore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Stone muſt be cut out later.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe Daniel doth not ſee the Stone to ſmite, untill ſuch time as he had had a view and repreſentation of the great Image in all the parts of it before him, he ſaw it all come forth and exiſt in its ſtate, before the Stone ſmites, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that the cutting out of the Stone was not untill every part of it was come forth, and was in being in the world.</hi> But if ſo be we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49133:50"/>the cutting out of the Stone to be as high as Chriſts coming; then was the Stone cut out long before the laſt part of the great Image (the Iron and the Clay) was in being; and if the Stone was cut out ſo long before, then did the Stone lye ſtill, and not doe its worke for many hundred yeares (ſurely it ſhould not lye ſtill for ſo many hundred yeares, and not doe the worke it was ordained to) for the very firſt ſtroake the Stone ſtrikes, is upon the feete of Iron and Clay, which it could doe before they were in being.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe Daniels ſmiting Stone that he ſpeakes of in the ſecond Chapter, and Daniels Antient of dayes ſitting, that he ſpeakes of in the</hi> 7 <hi>Chapter, they muſt of neceſſity be one and the ſame, they are contemporary, for they doe one and the ſame worke, the very worke that is done by the one, is done by the other.</hi> The Stone ſmites the Toes of the fourth Monarchy, and <hi>Daniels</hi> Antient of dayes ſitting, caſts downe the Thrones, and Judges, and deſtroy's the fourth Beaſt, here's one and the ſame worke, therefore they are one and the ſame time, the <hi>Time of the cutting out</hi> of the Stone, is the ſame with the <hi>time of the ſitting</hi> of the Antient of dayes. Now if they are the <hi>ſame in time,</hi> the Stone cannot be cut out ſo high as Chriſts firſt coming, for the Antient of dayes ſitting, its cleare its not till the <hi>ending time</hi> of the fourth Monarchy; then comes the Antient of dayes and ſitts in Judgement, and caſts downe and deſtroy's the Beaſt and not before; therefore the cutting out of the Stone cannot be the firſt time, but at the cloſe of the fourth Monarchy. And ſeeing it is ſo, that the kingdome of the Stone is <hi>a part of the fift kingdome</hi> or Monarchy,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49133:51"/>and alſo ſeeing that the cutting out of this Stone, its not till <hi>towards the latter end</hi> of the fourth kingdome or Monarchy, then it doth follow, that this fift kingdome or Monarchy doth begin as its the kingdome of the Stone, at the latter end of the fourth Monarchy, and then of neceſſity it muſt have a beginning as its the kingdome of the Stone, before Chriſts appearance.</p>
            <p>Now if it can be made appeare, that that, with which the fift kingdome doth begin, <hi>the worke of the great Image, the overturning the Thrones of the kings,</hi> is to be performed by the Saints, as chiefe Inſtruments in the mannagement of it, then, it followes of neceſſity there muſt be ſuch a thing, <hi>As the Civill and Military Power to be in the hands of the Saints, and that before the day of Chriſts appearance,</hi> they muſt have this Power in their hands for the performance of that work; and if ſo, then <hi>its not evill for the Saints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, to ſeeke for it, to pray for it, to plead for it,</hi> for its to come into their hands for the doing of their worke before the day of Chriſts appearance. Now that this worke with which the fift kingdome doth begin, <hi>is a worke to be performed by Saints, as the cheife and principall Inſtruments in the doing of it,</hi> is that that I would ſpeake ſomewhat to at preſent. That there is a wonderfull glorious bleſſed worke to be done by the Saints in the world before the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Jeſus Chriſt. The</p>

               <hi>Becauſe the worke of breaking the great Image, its done by the Stone cut out of the Mountaine;</hi> its not done by Mountaines conſidered as Mountaines, its not done by nations conſidered as nations, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

            <p>

               <hi>Anſ:</hi> I anſwer, Its cleare, they ſhall for the cheife, principall and leading Inſtruments be Saints, and that upon this account, <hi>that they are called A Stone:</hi> why are they called <hi>the Stone?</hi> but indeed in relation to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt king of Saints, whoſe name and title this is, who is called <hi>a Stone:</hi> they are partakers of the name of Chriſt, to ſhew that they ſhall alſo partake of his nature; they ſhall have the Image of Chriſt upon them, therefore the name of Chriſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them. If the worke were to be done by the kingdomes of this world, by nations as nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what agreement were there between Chriſt and them? what agreement is there between
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49133:52"/>Chriſt and a company of poore Ignorant ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men? But there is a great agreement between thoſe that ſhall doe this worke and Chriſt, for therefore they have the name of Chriſt given to them; and ſeeing it is ſo, it ſhall not be done by the body's of nations as nations, but by a people <hi>cut out of the Mountaine,</hi> out of the nations, by God himſelfe for the carrying on of this worke.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49133:55"/>O Greece, and made thee as th ſword of a mighty man:</hi> marke! <hi>Raiſed up thy Sons, O Zion, againſt thy Sons, O Greece;</hi> who are they that are raiſed up againſt the Sons of <hi>Greece,</hi> that is, againſt the <hi>Turiſh</hi> power, as I ſhewed you formerly? they are the Sons of <hi>Zion, I will raiſe up thy Sons, O Zion;</hi> whereas there was in all the foregoing Monarchy's, one earthly Power raiſed up againſt another, when it comes to the very laſt time, God raiſes up another manner of Power, <hi>I will raiſe up thy Sons, O Zion, againſt thy Sons, O Greece.</hi> So if you looke into <hi>Obadiah</hi> 18 &amp; 21 verſes; <hi>And the Houſe of Jacob ſhall be a fire, and the Houſe of Joſeph a flame, and the Houſe of Eſau for ſtubble, and they ſhall kindle in them, and devoure them, and there ſhall not be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the Houſe of Eſau, for the Lord hath ſpoken it. And Saviours ſhall come upon Mount Zion to Judge the Mount of Eſau, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall be the Lords. Saviours ſhall got up on Mount Zion;</hi> who ſhall they be? <hi>the Houſe of Jacob, and the Houſe of Joſeph</hi> ſhall burne up the Mount of <hi>Eſau,</hi> they ſhall Judge the Houſe of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and then ſhall the kingdome be the Lords; the univerſall kingdome of the Lord is not yet come in; but here comes in the kingdome of the Stone, <hi>the Houſe of Jacob ſhall be a fire, and the Houſe of Joſeph a flame,</hi> they ſhall burne up all the workes of the world; and <hi>Saviours ſhall come up upon Mount Zion, and Judge the Mount of Eſau:</hi> When all his Enemies are brought downe and become his footſtoole, then ſhall he come forth and take the kingdome, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall be the Lords; <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, uneill I make thine Enemies thy footſtoole,</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49133:55"/>then the Lord ſhall ſend the rod of thy ſtrength out of <hi>Zion, rule thou in the mid'ſt of thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> there's the coming forth of Chriſt when his Enemies by his Saints are made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole. So likewiſe if you looke into <hi>Micah,</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Now alſo many nations are gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, that ſay, let her be defiled, and let our eye looke upon Zion;</hi> This gathering of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is not after Chriſts coming but before, and what then? <hi>Ariſe and Threſh, O daughter of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for I will make thine Horne Iron, and I will make thy Hoof's braſſe, and thou ſhalt beate in pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces many people, and I will conſecrate their gaine unto the Lord, and their ſubſtance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</hi> Who ſhall ariſe and threſh? ariſe and threſh O daughter of <hi>Zion;</hi> ſhee ſhall have Hornes of Iron and Hoof's of braſſe, to beate all the Enemies of Chriſt into very chaffe and duſt, as its ſaid the great Image was ground to powder; why, its <hi>Zion,</hi> the poore deſpiſed daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> ſhe that they ſtood looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſaid, <hi>Let her be defiled, let our eyes look upon Zion;</hi> they ſtood jeering at <hi>Zion,</hi> and ſaith God, <hi>Zion,</hi> I will make thee a trouble and a torment to them all; come up <hi>Zion,</hi> and I will make thy Hornes Iron, and thy Hoof's braſſe, and thou ſhalt breake all the nations to peices that now ſtand looking upon thee. And in another place the Lord tells us, <hi>Jacob is his Battell-Axe, and weapons of warre;</hi> ſo ſaith God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.20. <hi>For with thee will I breake in peices the nations, and with thee will I deſtroy kingdomes.</hi> When he comes to worke his great worke in the world, his faithfull Children ſhall be his weapons to bring it to paſſe. Come to the new Teſtament,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49133:56"/>and we ſhall ſee who God will make his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to carry on his worke againſt the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.2. <hi>And I ſaw as it were a ſea of glaſſe, mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his marke, and over the number of his name, ſtand on the ſea of glaſſe, having the Harps of God.</hi> And in the 6 verſe, <hi>And the ſeven Angels came out of the Temple, having the ſeven laſt plagues, clothed in pure and white linnen, and having their Breaſts girded with golden girdles.</hi> They ſhall be pretious Inſtruments, they ſhall have much puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Holines, and much of the Image of God upon them, and much of the beauty and riches of Chriſt in them, that ſhall doe this worke; ſo, if we looke into <hi>Revel:</hi> 14. where, after the Beaſts time is run out, (in the 13 Chapter, we have the Beaſt tryumphing, and the Beaſt's time running out in 42 moneths, now after this) we have another kinde of perſons, another party coming upon the ſtage, <hi>Revel:</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5 verſes. <hi>And I looked, and lo, a Lamb ſtood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred fourty and foure thouſand, having his Fathers name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers, harping with their harpes. And they ſung as it it were a new ſong before the throne, &amp; before the four beaſts, and the elders, and no man could learne that ſong, but the hundred and fourty and four thouſand, which were redeemed from the earth. Theſe are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins: theſe are they which follow the Lamb witherſoever he goeth: theſe were redeemed from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49133:56"/>among men, being the firſt-fruits unto God, and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</hi> What a generation of men come up upon the ſtage when the Beaſt's 42 moneths are run out, for that had been ſpoken to in the foregoing Chapter; when that time is run out, up comes the Lamb with his company, and they are a company not like to the world, for, they have <hi>their fathers name written in their foreheads,</hi> there's holines in their foreheads, they are a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>whoſe mouth there is no guile;</hi> they doe not act in ſubtill polliticke wayes, as men doe and have done. So that, I ſay, Conſider thoſe that ſhall carry on this worke, where ever we have them ſpoken of, in the old and new Teſtament, they are ſtill ſet forth as Saints, for the principalls and leaders in this worke. I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what large in this, for if we cannot find a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome till Chriſt come, all the ſignes will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, therefore I have ſpoken the more to this; but it may be objected;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That its the ten Hornes that hate the whore, if you looke into <hi>Revel:</hi> 17.16. the ten Hornes are ſaid to doe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> To that I anſwer, <hi>Wee muſt ſo interpret this, as not to ſet it againſt the generall current of Scripture.</hi> Now whereas, the ten Hornes are ſaid <hi>to hate the whore, and make her deſolate, and burne her with fire;</hi> the meaning is this, that the ten Hornes as being conquered to the Lamb, and the power of them being gotten into the power of the Lamb, ſo ſhall the Hornes be turned againſt the whore; and indeed, this well agrees to the ſcope of the place, for its ſaid in the 14 verſe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49133:57"/>
               <hi>Theſe ſhall make warre with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them.</hi> There was warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Lamb and ſome of the Hornes, (for we are not here to underſtand all the ten Hornes) and in this warre, the Lamb becomes the victor; and then the Hornes which before did fight for the Beaſt, and ſupport the Beaſt, (when the power of the Hornes comes into the hands of the Lamb) they turne againſt the Beaſt; and indeed ſeeing its done by the Hornes as conquered to the Lamb, its cleare that in that day, ſuch of the Hornes as ſhall doe it, ſhall be ruled by the Lamb; and if ſo, why then there ſhall be ſuch a thing as the kingdome of Chriſt, even in the Hornes, when this is done: And truly, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee at preſent that yet this kingdome is in the Hornes, that yet the Hornes are conquered to the Lamb, ſo that the Lamb raignes in the Hornes; the kingdome of the Lamb is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Righteouſneſſe, a kingdome wherein there ſhall be no injuſtice, oppreſſion, and the like; we cannot ſee that there is yet ſuch a thing among the Hornes, and though it is not yet, yet, when he comes to take the kingdome, he will make the Hornes other manner of Hornes, and when he comes to doe it, he will doe it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſts kingdome is not of this world, and therefore it cannot be expected any ſuch thing ſhould be as the beginning of the kingdome of Chriſt, till the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> Its worthy our Conſideration, <hi>Who the perſon was, to whom that was ſpoken, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thoſe words were ſpoken by Chriſt:</hi> The perſon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49133:57"/>to whom the words were ſpoken, was <hi>Pilate</hi> the Roman Governour; The occaſion was, when he was accuſed before <hi>Pilate,</hi> as an Enemie to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> as one that would have tooke <hi>Caeſar's</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from him; Jeſus Chriſt anſwers upon it; <hi>My kingdome is not of this world,</hi> that is, of this Mornarchy, for the whole world at that time was under the Roman Monarchy; <hi>There went forth a decree from Caeſar, that all the world ſhould be taxed;</hi> for ſo indeed, the whole world, and Monarchy, are tearmes Equivalent; ſo that, <hi>My kingdome is not of this world,</hi> that is, its not of this Monarchy: It was a very good anſwer to that that was objected againſt him, <hi>Caeſar</hi> feares I will take the kingdome from him, no ſaith Chriſt, my kingdome is not of this world, its not to be in this Monarchy; I have a kingdome but its not yet, I will not take <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Crowne off his head, I ſhall have a kingdome hereafter, but <hi>Caeſar</hi> needs not feare me now; this comes in about <hi>Pilats</hi> querying with him about his being aking. There is ſuch a thing therefore, yet before the coming of Chriſt, as the ſetting up the kingdome of Chriſt in the world, as the ſame ſhall be <hi>the kingdome of the Stone, breaking in peices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all other kingdomes.</hi> And having thus ſpoken unto this, I ſhall now come to ſpeake of the ſignes of the Times, the ſignes that this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is nigh at hand, that Jeſus Chriſt is neere to his worke; ſeeing there is ſuch a worke to be done in the latter end of the fourth Monarchy, whether or no is this worke neere at hand, or is it far off and remote?</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpeake any thing at all as to the Computation of the time from the numbers left
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49133:58"/>us in Scripture, though much may be learned from them, for doubtleſſe the Lord hath not left us numbers to the end there ſhould be no uſe at all made of them, for there's nothing in the word of God but its of ſome uſe; but that I ſhall not ſpeake to, but proceed to ſhew you ſome of the ſignes of The Times.</p>

               </gap> Chriſt, as its the kingdome of the Stone, is neere at hand, is this, <hi>The wonderfull breaking forth of light as to this worke;</hi> its very obſervable, that when the worke of God is to be carryed on againſt the Beaſt, there doth forerun the worke a glorious light; ſo, if you looke into <hi>Revel:</hi> 14 6 &amp; 7 verſes, we have <hi>an Angel flying in the midſt of Heaven, having the Everlaſting Goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, ſaying with a loud voice feare God, and give glory to him, for the houre of his Judgement is come;</hi> and what then? why in the next verſe there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes <hi>another Angel, ſaying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen;</hi> an Angel goes forth and enlightens the earth, preaches and declares it in the world, that now the houre of Gods Judgement is come, the houre is come ſaith he, and preſently another Angel cryes out, <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, is fallen; the worke of God comes on preſently after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing of light; <hi>Revel:</hi> 18.1, 2. <hi>The earth was enlightened with his glory;</hi> and then preſently verſe 6. <hi>Reward her even as ſhee rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her workes; in the cup which ſhee hath filled, fill to her double:</hi> and in the 8 verſe, <hi>Therefore ſhall her plagues
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49133:58"/>come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and ſhee ſhall be utterly burnt with fire.</hi> Obſerve firſt here's an Angel comes and enlightens the earth with the glory of God, the earth that was before in darknes, and thought nothing of the ruine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Judging the Beaſt; the Lord lets in wonderfull light into the world, and then preſently comes forth the work it ſelfe, the Lord doth appeare judging of the Beaſt; Likewiſe, if you looke to the final blow given to the Beaſt; <hi>Revel:</hi> 19. you will ſee that it follows after light that doth forerun it, 17 and 18 verſes, <hi>And I ſaw an Angel ſtanding in the Sun, and he cryed with a loud voice, ſaying to all the fowles that fly in the mid'ſt of heaven, come, and gather your ſelves together to the ſupper of the great God, that ye may eate the fleſh of kings, and the fleſh of Captaines, and the fleſh of mighty men, and the fleſh of Horſes, and of them that ſit on them, and the fleſh of all men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great.</hi> Here's the laſt overthrow, the deadly blow the Lord gives the Beaſt; and there foreruns it a wonderfull light, an Angel <hi>ſtands in the Sun,</hi> that is, in wonderfull cleare light; he ſtands, holding forth and declaring the coming of that terrible day; and preſently upon that light, the worke comes on. I ſay, this is a ſigne of the time, that the worke is at hand, <hi>The great diſcovery of light as to the worke,</hi> the Lord brings forth.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſons why God will ſend forth light before his worke, are;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe he would not lead his Children to his worke blindfold, but by light.</hi> Antichriſts followers, they follow in the dark, in the miſt of Implicit faith; but the Lambs followers; they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49133:59"/>are led by light. Practice without principle hath ever been the way of the Beaſt, but Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the rule of practice is Chriſts Method.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe a Saint, though the thing he doe be good and the will of God, yet can never have comfort in doing it, if it be not done from light.</hi> My Comfort ly's in this that I know I follow the Lord; and this bore up <hi>Paul,</hi> when Brethren Cenſured him, and others accounted him a mad man. Now obſerve, when God let's forth a light, its in order to a worke; thus, when God began with the Papacy, to overturne their groſſe Idolatry's, God by <hi>Luther</hi> and ſome few others brings forth light to diſcover theſe, and upon that diſcovery, they fall. So afterwards, when God went to Judge the Prelacy here in <hi>England,</hi> firſt he brings forth light, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers them to be a peice of the Beaſt, and of the myſtery of Iniquity, and preſently upon the coming forth of that light they fall; when God ſends light, he will bring forth the worke ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Wee have had light of this a great while, and pleaded for the kingdome of Chriſt, and therefore this cannot be a ſigne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> To that I anſwer, We muſt conſider <hi>there is a difference between the breaking forth of light, as it is the light of ſome particular perſons, and as its the light in a more generall way among many, then is the worke coming forth. John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> held forth <hi>Luthers</hi> light, before <hi>Luther,</hi> and while it was but in the breaſts of ſome few perſons, it did no great matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Beaſt's kingdome, but when it came to be generall in the world, then the Blow came,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49133:59"/>the kingdome of the Beaſt was deſtroyed by that light, ſo much of it, as that light ſerv'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. Whilſt that light that oppoſed the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Prelacy, was lodged up onely in ſome few breaſts, it produced little, ſave onely a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt them; but when it began to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, it toſſed them out of their ſeates. So I may ſay concerning this light, the light of the kingdome of Chriſt, it hath been in ſome few breaſts a great while, but it never began to be ſo generall untill now, that its run among the Churches; Indeed never was there a Principle that did run ſo much among the Churches of Chriſt, as this hath done within theſe twelve moneths; ſince ſome Eminent ſervants of Chriſt have been ſhut up, and thruſt into holes, this light hath been encreaſed and embraced among the Saints, ſo as never any light encreas't more in ſuch a little time, than this hath done; and when light begins to be ſo generall, its an argument now the worke drawes on, it begins to be hot as we ſay; and indeed the light growes ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that the perſecuting adverſary who not long agoe would not acknowledge any kingdome at all but the ſpirituall, yet now they acknowledge ſuch a thing as the fift Monarchy in the world, though they would ſet it far off, that it might not hurt them, and are driven to confeſſe, that, that very principle, for which Saints ſuffer at this day, is in the ſubſtance of it a truth. Light is coming forth apace, and bleſſed be the Lord that hath been ſo mercifull to his people at this day, that the proud Adverſary's of the truth &amp; cauſe of God, ſhall one day be Judged out of their owne mouths, they themſelves know that there
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49133:60"/>is ſuch a kingdome, they have gotten ſome light into it, and they ſhall one day be Judged out of their owne mouthes.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Signe. </seg>2</label> Another Signe of this time, that the worke of God, of Chriſts kingdome is neere upon us, is this, <hi>Syons Children favouring of her ſtones and duſt;</hi> the ground of this we have in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 102.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon Syon: for the time to favour her, yea, the ſet time is come.</hi> That this Pſalme look's to Chriſt's outward kingdome, the 15, 18, &amp; 22 verſes Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But what ſigne is there of it, that the ſet time is come? why in the 14 verſe, <hi>When the Saints of God take pleaſure in the ſtones of Syon, and begin to favour the duſt thereof, then, the ſet time of building Syon is come.</hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49133:60"/>pulling downe Thrones; now the Children of <hi>Syon,</hi> take pleaſure in the ſtones, and they favour the duſt of it.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Signe. </seg>3</label> that this worke is approaching upon us, is, <hi>The great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that is upon the Remnant that expect this worke.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they had a double worke, they had a ſpirituall worke, &amp; a Civill worke, the worke of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the worke of the Citty <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and thoſe who expected the carrying on the Civill worke of building the Citty <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the walls thereof, they were made a wonderfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; <hi>Nehem:</hi> 1.3. <hi>And they ſaid unto me, The Remnant that are left of the Captivity there in the Province, are in great affliction &amp; reproach; the wall of Jeruſalem alſo is broken downe, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</hi> Mark! the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are in great affliction; what Remnant? why, the Remnant that are left of the Captivity, the Remnant that did expect the Citty <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſhould be built, they are become a reproach; the worke of building of the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is delayed, till the Remnant doe become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: the people of God had their Temple done, they were ſet upon building their Citty, for they were told by their Prophets, that they ſhould build their Temple and their Citty too, and now the people cry unto them and laugh at them, where is your Citty? where is your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that you talke of? you would have the Citty built, and you would have a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſet up, and a kingdome, but where is it? never ſuch reproach comes upon waiters, as when the worke is ready to peepe forth; then, at that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49133:61"/>time when they were ſo reproached was the worke ready to come forth; then <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is brought on his knees, and ſpreads the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, in the fourth verſe, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for building the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was given forth thereupon, even that very yeare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Babylon</hi> litterall, was a type of the kingdome of <hi>Babylon</hi> myſticall; their <hi>Babylon</hi> was a type of our <hi>Babylon;</hi> and as it was then, ſo it is now, upon the coming out of <hi>Babylon</hi> we have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worke, a worke of the Temple, and a worke of the Citty; the Temple-worke is finiſhed, and that is ſuffered to ſtand; but now the Saints looke for their Civill work, for their Common-wealth, and that is become a reproach; for is not this the reproach at this day, theſe are the fift Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-men, and where is now your fift king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, your fift Monarchy? never was that growne to ſuch a reproach this ten yeares; how have they been reproached even by ſome who are now compelled to acknowledge a truth in the principle? Now obſerve, when the worke was reproached, then the worke went on; and as that was the time then for the carrying on of the worke; why ſo now, the worke being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with us alſo, its a ſigne that this is the time for the carrying on of the worke now: And truly its worthy our obſervation, How, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this worke was come to be a reproach, it went on in a wonderfull way, the worke of <hi>Jeruſalem; Nehem:</hi> 6.16. <hi>So the wall was finiſhed, in the</hi> 25 <hi>day of the moneth Elul, in</hi> 52 <hi>dayes.</hi> In 52 dayes! what a wonderfull thing is it, that the wall of ſuch a Citty as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, ſhould be built in 52 dayes, and that by ſo few hands? And this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49133:61"/>little handfull were many of them forc't to take their ſwords in their hands. The Temple was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building a great while, &amp; they needed no ſwords to that worke; but now they come to their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-worke, they have their ſwords in their hands to defend themſelves, becauſe there were many Enemies of that worke; and yet notwithſtanding all their Enemies, and all the oppoſition, it was done as it were by a miracle in 52 dayes. So the worke of the kingdome it ſhall come on apace, ſuddenly, in one houre ſhall this worke come on; in 52 dayes was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> walled notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the reproach which Immediatly before was caſt upon them.</p>

               <hi>The preſent doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that is in many godly ſpirits about this worke, as being neere;</hi> its a cleare ſigne that the worke is at hand: Two or three yeares ſince, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ't a great deale of faith about this worke, they preach't it up, we ſhall goe on wonderfully, we ſhall goe on to <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall pull downe Tythes &amp;c. But now their ſpirits are ſunke, and they ſay, its not yet time; this is ſo far from a diſcouragement, as that its a great ſigne that the worke is neere; for this is a cleare Rule, that when ever Chriſt brings forth a worke in the world, he will bring it forth ſo, as that he ſhall not find faith on Earth; hence you have it, <hi>Luk:</hi> 18.8. <hi>Nevertheleſſe, when the Son of man cometh, ſhall he find faith on Earth?</hi> It hath been the uſuall way of God, even to ſtrike dead the faith of his Children when the worke is at the birth, ſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.20, 21. after the death upon the worke there, and their burdens are doubled, <hi>they meete Moſes and Aaron, who ſtood in the way,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49133:62"/>as they came forth from Pharaoh, and they ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the Lord looke upon you, and Judge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have made our ſavour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his ſervants, to put a ſword in their hands to ſlay us.</hi> Obſerve, the People that juſt before beleived, and ſaid, O the work is come, and the day of our deliverance is at hand, in the end of the former Chapter the text ſaith, <hi>The people beleived when they heard that the Lord had viſited the Children of Iſrael, and that he had looked upon their affliction, and they bowed their heads and worſhipped:</hi> Though they beleived in the former Chapter that their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was now at hand, yet they doubt in this Chapter; as ſoone as ever the death comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worke, they murmur and doubt of it, and blame <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> telling them they had <hi>made their ſavour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, and of his ſervants, to put a ſword in their hands to ſlay us.</hi> So it was with <hi>David,</hi> when the worke of his kingdome firſt came forth, when he firſt ſet out againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> he had a great deale of confidence at firſt, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 22.22. <hi>David ſaith to Abiathar, Abide thou with me, feare not: for he that ſeekes my life ſeeketh thy life; but with me thou ſhalt be in ſafety</hi> But obſerve, after this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> loſt his confidence, and came to doubt of the going on of this worke of his kingdome, in the 27 Chapter the firſt verſe, <hi>I ſhall now periſh one day by the hand of Saul;</hi> he ſpeakes quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what he ſaid before, yet now the worke is neere, the kingdome is ready to riſe: So when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to come out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and a death came upon the worke, they cryed out, <hi>The time is not come, the time is not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49133:62"/>come that the Lords houſe ſhould be built;</hi> here they doubt as to the time, their faith was downe, yet then was the time at hand, and the worke was carryed on in the ſecond yeare of <hi>Darius.</hi> So likewiſe, looke to Chriſt himſelfe when he was here, the Diſciples a little before his death, they could ſay to him, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the Living God,</hi> they had much of faith at firſt, but when Chriſt is in the grave they looſe their faith, <hi>We truſted that it was he that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael;</hi> their faith was gone, and yet their Redemption was nearer than ever it was, and Chriſts Reſurrection at hand; ſo that while they were Queſtioning and doubting, the time of Chriſts riſing approaches: So abundance of good men, that formerly have kept to <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallow's</hi>-meeting, and <hi>Blackfryers</hi>-meeting, they have now of late withdrawne, and cry, <hi>the time is not come, the time is not come,</hi> for the carrying on of the worke of Chriſts kingdome, but this is ſo far from making us beleive <hi>the time is not come,</hi> that its a ſigne to us, that <hi>the time is at hand,</hi> when doubting comes after the ſpirit of faith, for ſo it hath been with the worke of the Lord in all his Diſpenſations.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49133:63"/>great ſpirit of prayer given to him, when the time came that the Citty <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be built: And God hath promiſed Immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he builds <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to give ſuch a ſpirit of prayer; <hi>Iſai</hi> 62.1.6. &amp; 7 verſes; <hi>For Zions ſake will I not hold my peace, and for Jeruſalems ſake I will not reſt, untill the righteouſneſſe thereof goe forth as brightnes, and the ſalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.

               <p>What a ſpirit of prayer was there up in the Biſhops times? and what was the effect of it? it brought their Ruine: Afterwards, when Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery was like to tread us downe, as did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops their predeceſſors, a great ſpirit of prayer was in many, by this they are ruined: And truly I thinke I may ſay, there was never a greater ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer up, than is at this day.

               <p>Firſt, Conſider, That God gives his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a larger Commiſſion (if I may ſo ſpeake) when they are to pray againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> than at other times. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Holy one of Iſrael, and his maker, Aske me of things to come concerning my ſons, and concerning the worke of my hands command ye me.</hi>

                  <hi>The Helples condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Gods people at preſent are in:</hi> Before God makes his Arme bare in ſaving, he brings his Children into that ſtraight, that they can ſee ſtrength no were elſe, but in him: hence, thoſe that pray for <hi>Syons</hi> Reſtauration, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 102. pray as deſtitute ones; and when they are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, God anſwers them: Never untill this day (ſince ſome appearings of this worke have been) have Gods people prayed as deſtitute ones: we had A Parliament, An Army, A Generall that went along with us till of late, but now Gods people are wholly deſtitute: and indeed, that they are brought into this condition is a mercy, and an evidence the worke is neere, which we might conclude to be farther off, were it not thus. A notable place we have, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge his people, and repent himſelfe for his ſervants; when he ſeeth that their Power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this hath ever been Gods way; <hi>Abraham</hi> cannot have his Mercy, till he is in ſo deſtitute a condition, as that to an eye of Reaſon he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope. <hi>David</hi> before the kingdome falls into his hands, muſt be ſo deſtitute, as that he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly the land.

               <p>Seventhly, A ſeventh ſigne, is,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Signe. </seg>7</label> 
                  <hi>The Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the oppreſſed people;</hi> who are the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed people, in a more eſpeciall manner at this day, but thoſe that appeare for this truth? who are ſhut up in priſons and Holes, but they?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49133:64"/>and yet notwithſtanding what a multiplying of them is there under this oppreſſion.

               <p>What a multiplication of this oppreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there is all the nation over, ſince ſome have been in priſon, is well knowne to many; many Churches and Paſtors of Churches, who (not twelve moneths ſince) were averſe to this way, doe now owne it, preach it; I ſpeake what I know. Yea, I dare ſay, That if the preſent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this Nation, had ſet in counſell 12 months together, to contrive a way to ſpread the notion of the fift Monarchy, among the godly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Nation, they could not have thought upon a better, than the caſting of ſome Eminent leading Saints into Priſon; for, there is nothing that men as men, doe more affect, than to looke into that thing for which others ſuffer; and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Saints (who it may be would never elſe have minded the notion) are very Inquiſitive into the thing, which they ſee Brethren ſuffer for, and hereby they attaine light: thus God taketh the wiſe in their owne Craftineſs.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid in the Primitive times, <hi>The blood of Martyrs, ſeede of Churches.</hi> Did not Queene <hi>Mary</hi> by her cruelty, make thoſe who before were averſe to it, ready and willing to receive the Proteſtant Religion? Did not the Biſhops looſe themſelves this way? and by driving ſome few out of the Land, multiply the number of the oppreſſed people within it.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49133:64"/>
               <p> Saints ſuffering for truth, are the loudeſt and moſt powerfull Sermons of all others. See what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to this, <hi>Phil:</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>But I would ye ſhould underſtand, Brethren, that the things which happened unto me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the Goſpel. So that my bonds in Chriſt are manifeſt in all the Pallace, and in all other places.</hi>

                  <hi>The great dread that is upon the ſpirits of all men (that are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) of ſuch a thing riſing in the world, as a fift Monarchy.</hi> What a dread at the time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was upon the <hi>Canaanites?</hi> and this dread is at the end of the forty yeares, we doe not reade of ſuch a dread at their firſt coming out; but when the worke was juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, of their taking poſſeſſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, then the feare and dread fall's upon
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49133:65"/>them. Its obſervable, that from the time that <hi>David</hi> was anointed king, a dread of him (though <hi>Saul</hi> had all the forts and ſtrength of the Nation) was upon the ſpirit of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what a dread is there upon the ſpirits of thoſe that oppoſe the worke (this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) of Chriſt at this day? its viſible enough, a dread already from the Lord, is fallen upon them.</p>

Before, he could deny himſelfe, and refuſe a kingdome; Afterwards, before another ſhall come into his Throne, he will ſlay innocent <hi>David,</hi> be it right or wrong, and all the Prieſts of God to boote. Before, though he had cauſe, and was ſtirr'd up to it, he will by no meanes perſecute; afterwards, though he had no juſt cauſe (all things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) he puts the Lords Prieſts to death Before, he was a very meeke man in all his actings; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, he acts like a Mad man.</p>

                  <hi>Davids kingdome was now riſing, and Saul being in heart an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to it, the Spirit of the Lord withdraws from him;</hi> and this withdrawing was the Immediate forerunner of <hi>Davids</hi> kingdome, the moſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent type of Chriſt's, pleaded for at this day</p>
               <p>Now let us Conſider, whether it be not thus at this day: let us looke to men <hi>that ſit upon the Throne;</hi> and men that <hi>call themſelves the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49133:65"/>is it not as evident as the Sun when it ſhines at noone day, that the Spirit of the Lord is <hi>withdrawne from both?</hi> I ſay, in reſpect of thoſe common gifts and aſſiſtances, they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had, whil'ſt they ſtood in the cauſe of God.</p>
               <p>Are there not men this day in <hi>England,</hi> that perſecute Saints, for laying open their evills and Apoſtacy's, who time was, would not perſecute them themſelves, nor ſuffer others who would have done it, to doe it?

               </p>
               <p>Looke to men who call <hi>themſelves the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;</hi> could not many, ſome yeares ſince, preach often, with life and power; now its a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (and truly they are not able to doe it) to preach once in a fortnight; and when they doe preach, that life they once had is ſo gone, that Chriſtians that heare, had they not the ſame names and faces, would not know them to be the men; once the time was, that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeake a ſeaſonable word, whenſoever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was offered, but truly now they are able to ſpeake no more than they have written in their paper, or got by heart, as the Schoolboyes doe.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49133:68"/>over the whole Goſpel of God, from firſt to laſt, and you ſhall find no other Corner Stone, no other bottome ſtone, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt onely: Chriſt is the corner ſtone (as the Apoſtle tells us) upon which, the foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles is built; <hi>Eph:</hi> 2.20. <hi>And are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe being the cheife Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone;</hi> the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets its here by the Apoſtle called <hi>a foundation,</hi> but its ſuch a <hi>foundation,</hi> as hath another <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> lying at the bottome of that, Jeſus Chriſt the Corner ſtone is laid at the bottome of this <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;</hi> Truth, its the <hi>foundation</hi> of our faith, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he is the <hi>foundation</hi> of truth, that <hi>foundation</hi> that truth ſtands upon, he is ſtill the <hi>bottome foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt may be called a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>In reſpect of his owne meetnes and fitnes every way to be a foundation;</hi> Chriſt he is the moſt meete and fit of all others to be a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>He is a Stone,</hi> as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I will lay in Syon for a foundation a ſtone;</hi> you know, if men goe to lay <hi>a foundation,</hi> they doe not goe and gather up duſt and rubbiſh, that is no fit matter <hi>for a foundation,</hi> but they goe and gather up <hi>Stones</hi> and lay them for <hi>a foundation;</hi> ſo our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is <hi>a ſtone, I lay in Syon for a foundation a ſtone,</hi> ſo there's a fitnes and meetnes in him for <hi>a foundation,</hi> he is moſt meete for <hi>a foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As he is a Stone, ſo, <hi>he is an Elect Choice Stone,</hi> he is a fit choſen ſtone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>I lay in Syon for a foundation, a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49133:68"/>cheife corner ſtone, Elect and precious;</hi> he is a fit ſtone: Men picke out of their beſt Stones for a foundation, ſo, he is a Stone pickt out by God himſelfe; when the Lord was to lay the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this bleſſed glorious building of our Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happines, God tooke a view (as I may ſo ſay) of men and Angells, and he could not find ſuch another <hi>Stone,</hi> ſo fit for a <hi>foundation</hi> as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was, he is a fit Stone. But againe,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He is a Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie Stone;</hi> ſo he is called in Scripture, <hi>the rocke,</hi> the <hi>rocke ſtone,</hi> 1 Cor: 10.4. <hi>And that rocke was Chriſt,</hi> and they that are offended at Chriſt, they are offended at the <hi>rocke,</hi> Rom. 9.33. He is <hi>a rocke of offence;</hi> they that ſmite againſt Chriſt, ſmite againſt the <hi>rocke,</hi> and therefore are broken to peices; <hi>And on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it will grind them to powder,</hi> Math: 21.44. Now the <hi>rocke ſtone</hi> is the greateſt, firmeſt and hardeſt Stone, and therefore the fitteſt for <hi>a foundation:</hi> And Chriſt being <hi>a Rocke,</hi> he is moſt fit for <hi>a foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He is a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stone;</hi> ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>I lay in Syon for a foundation, a ſtone, a tryed ſtone;</hi> that is, <hi>a ſtone</hi> that there hath been proofe made of every way, whether it would be fit for <hi>a foundation</hi> or no; there's great difference between <hi>ſtones,</hi> there are ſome <hi>ſtones,</hi> if you put them under the hammer, they will breake to peices, and there are ſome, if you put them into the furnace, they will melt, or moulder; But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is <hi>a tryed ſtone, a ſtone</hi> that hath been under the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the worlds rage, and under the Hammer
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49133:69"/>of Satans Temptations, and under the Hammer of our ſins and corruptions; And he hath been in the furn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce of his fathers wrath; and yet he is <hi>a ſolid ſtone</hi> ſtill; he is <hi>a tryed ſtone,</hi> and therefore fit for <hi>a foundation;</hi> he hath been ſo <hi>tryed,</hi> that the Lord ſaith of him, he is <hi>a ſure foundation;</hi> I am ſure (ſaith God) whatſoever is built upon my Son ſhall ſtand; I am ſure, what ever ſoule, what ever comfort, what ever obedience, ſtands there, ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt he is <hi>a Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stone,</hi> 1 Pet: 2.6. <hi>Behold, I lay in Syon for a foundation a ſtone, Elect and pretious,</hi> he is not a common ſtone, but <hi>a pretious ſtone;</hi> and indeed in this reſpect too, he is very meete, yea, moſt meete and fit of all others to be <hi>a foundation.</hi> There are two things in Chriſts being <hi>a pretious ſtone,</hi> that doe make him fit to be <hi>a foundation</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Thereby there is an Anſwerablenes in the foundation to the building;</hi> if a building be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, and made all of pretious pearle, its fit there ſhould be ſome anſwerablenes in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the building; the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> its ſaid of it, it was of <hi>pure gold,</hi> and the foundation of the Citty was of <hi>all manner of pretious ſtones,</hi> there was an anſwerablenes in the foundation to the building; ſo I may ſay, this bleſſed building of our Salvation, its indeed builded, that is, made up all of pretious pearle, there's the bleſſed pearle of the fathers love, there's the bleſſed pearles of our Redemption, Juſtification, Adoption, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; the whole is made up of pretious pearle; looke over every peice and part of it, every thing that is in this building, its of pretious pearle: Now the building it ſelfe being made up all of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49133:69"/>pearle, therefore the <hi>foundation</hi> muſt be ſome glorious thing, there muſt be <hi>an anſwerablenes in the foundation;</hi> now therefore we have this pretious Stone laid in the bottome, which indeed doth enrich the whole building, and add's to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very peice and parcell of it. And then Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pretious Corner Stone, he is moſt meete for a foundation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In regard, <hi>That of all Stones, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones are the moſt durable;</hi> The Adamant or the Diamond, which of all ſtones is the moſt pretious, of all ſtones none ſo hard, it will breake other things, and will not eaſily be broken, and cut other things, and it ſelfe cannot without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty be cut; Jeſus Chriſt he is a durable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, therefore there is not ſuch a foundation in all the world.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He is a living Stone;</hi> 1 Pet. 2.4. <hi>To whom coming as unto a living Stone, diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God and pretious;</hi> he is <hi>a living Stone,</hi> that is, he is ſuch a ſtone as hath life in it, and by that life there is</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>A Cementing of the building to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp; therefore a tranſforming the building into the nature of the foundation: Now conſider this, and of all others Chriſt is the <hi>moſt fit for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> for by this <hi>Cementing</hi> the building to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this building becomes unmoveable; though the building be never ſo glorious, yet if it can be taken off the foundation, what would become of the glory of the building? this is that that makes the building ſuch a bleſſed building, that it is ſo united to the <hi>foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that there can be no removing of it off the foundation, if the powers
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49133:70"/>of Hell come, and all the powers in the world come, there can be no removing of the building off the foundation, this is the bleſſed ſtate of thoſe ſoules in Chriſt; herein is Jeſus Chriſt moſt meete of all others for a foundation, becauſe ſo far as Chriſt is a foundation, he doth unite the building to himſelfe, fixes the building upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that there can be no removing of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from off the foundation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt, as he doth by this life that is in him Cement the building to himſelfe, ſo he doth <hi>tranſforme the building into his owne nature, by ſending up that life into the building that is in the foundation;</hi> hereby, the ſoule being <hi>tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> into the Image and nature of Chriſt, it doth preſerve the ſoule from rottennes and putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; you know how it is with living things, they doe not dye, they doe not rot and putrefie, but they are dead things that rot and putrefie; why now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by conveying of that life, that is in himſelfe, and ſending it up from himſelfe into the building, thereby the building is kept from rotting and putrifying: that ſoule, that is in him, doth not rot and putrifie, but take any other ſoule in the world, and he doth rot and putrifie at one time or other; if he doth not ſtand upon this foundation, all his comforts, all his enlargements will rot and vaniſh away at ſometime or other.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he is one Stone;</hi> its not ſaid, I lay in <hi>Syon</hi> for <hi>a fountaine</hi> Stones, but, <hi>I lay in Syon a Stone,</hi> one Stone; now this add's to the excellency of the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if <hi>a foundation</hi> be of <hi>one ſtone,</hi> its a great deale the ſtronger; Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>one Stone,</hi> and ſo the moſt meete for <hi>a foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49133:70"/>
            <p> Fourthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is called a foundation, <hi>In reſpect of beleivers being built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him:</hi> all thoſe that are of the fathers building (as every true beleiver is) are <hi>builded</hi> upon this <hi>foundation;</hi> Truly there are a great many in the world, that goe to build up this building of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and they attempt to <hi>build</hi> it themſelves, now what man or woman goes to <hi>build</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, its with them, as its with little Children, they will goe to Imitate builders, get a little dirt and clay together <hi>to build</hi> a little houſe, but they neglect, they never mind the <hi>foundation;</hi> ſo its with theſe ſoules, they <hi>build</hi> themſelves up, they <hi>build</hi> their Juſtification, and <hi>build</hi> their Comfort, and <hi>build</hi> an obedience of their owne, but they regard not <hi>the foundation,</hi> if they can get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Comfort, and conformitie to duties, and the like, they never looke to the <hi>true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:</hi> I am afraid, that when the Lord comes to ſhake the world, a great many will be found without <hi>a ſoundation;</hi> but now all thoſe that are of the fathers <hi>building,</hi> they are <hi>built</hi> upon this <hi>foundation;</hi> the father he <hi>builds</hi> like a wiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-builder, when he comes to <hi>build</hi> a houſe, he takes ſpeciall care about the <hi>foundation,</hi> that that be laid firme and ſure, for (ſaith he) what will ye build if there be not <hi>a foundation</hi> laid? ſo is it when the Lord comes to your ſoules, to <hi>build</hi> you, man or woman, he lookes to <hi>the foundation,</hi> I will lay their ſoules upon my Son ſaith God; when God takes a ſoule into his hands, the very firſt worke that he doth, is, to lay <hi>the foundation,</hi> to ſee that Jeſus Chriſt be laid as <hi>the foundation</hi> in the ſoule: ſo that, Jeſus Chriſt may be called <hi>a foundation,</hi> in reſpect of the fathers <hi>building of all beleivers upon him as a foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:49133:71"/>
            <p> Laſtly, Jeſus Chriſt is called a foundation, <hi>In oppoſition to all other foundations, to all falſe foundations:</hi> there are a multitude of falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in the world, and in oppoſition to all the ſandy and falſe foundations that we lay, and that ſometimes Satan lay's, and that are not of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's laying, Chriſt is the foundation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt is a foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to thoſe vaine and empty hopes, that ſome ſinners have of amendment of life for the future:</hi> Truly, this cannot properly be called <hi>a foundation,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are a company of poore ſinners in the world, that goe on in drunkennes, ſwearing, whoredome, and the like, though they know themſelves to be miſerable and wretched, to be undone, yet they hope they ſhall amend hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſhall be better one day, and ſo they take ſome kinde of reſt from this thought. A man that makes no conſcience of ſwearing, or cozening, or lying, or defrauding, when his conſcience comes and tells him, thou art a miſerable wretch, he anſwers, I hope to be better hereafter; now this mans <hi>foundation</hi> is, as if a man ſhould goe about to build a houſe in the ayre; Chriſt is a foundation <hi>in oppoſition to theſe vaine hopes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is a foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to Phariſaicall righteouſneſſe and holines:</hi> ſome there are that come to have a <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> though not the <hi>righteouſnes</hi> of God, but indeed <hi>a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of their owne,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith; they are not as other men are, they are not drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, nor ſwearers, they ſerve God, and walke honeſtly, they will not cheate, and they make conſcience of their word, they will have but one word when you come to deale with them, they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49133:71"/>will deale honeſtly and juſtly in all their wayes; and therefore ſurely ſay they, we are the Children of God, and are in a good condition, and thus they lay a great deale of ſtreſſe and weight upon their <hi>Phariſaicall righteouſnes and holines.</hi> Thus it was with the Scribes and Phariſees in Chriſts time, O ſaith he, <hi>I am not like that Publican,</hi> I am not ſo and ſo, <hi>God I thanke thee, I am not as other men be,</hi> I am a bleſſed man, a happy man; I but yet he is a poore miſerable Phariſee ſtill, Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, notwithſtanding all this he was not Juſtified, Chriſt ſends him away as a poore miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretch, notwithſtanding all his <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Except therefore</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>your Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exceed the righteouſnes of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heaven:</hi> Chriſt is a foundation in oppoſition to this foundation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is a foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to conviction of ſin, conviction of our naturall ſtate and condition:</hi> Some there are, that goe farther than the Phariſee, (who reſt's in his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, far from being convinc't of ſin) that come to ſee themſelves loſt and undone, and it may be they come &amp; gather up hope, they ſcrape up ſomewhat of comfort here, becauſe they find and feele themſelves ſinners, that therefore God will pardon them, becauſe they conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be loſt, therefore God will ſave them, therefore they ſhall have heaven and Everlaſting Salvation, they gather up comfort here: but this is no other foundation than wicked <hi>Cain</hi> may have, ſaith he, <hi>I am a caſt away, and my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater than I can beare;</hi> this is not the foundation, Chriſt is the foundation <hi>in oppoſition to this conviction of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:49133:72"/>
            <p> Fourthly, Chriſt is a foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to confeſſion of ſin to others;</hi> that is that which ſome lay as a foundation of their comfort, when they are oppreſſ't and burden'd, and afflicted with their ſin, they run and tell it to others, and will be open-hearted, and when they have ſo done they finde eaſe, and have much comfort, peace, and hope, and they build upon it, as a man that is ſtomack-ſicke, he caſts up that which is at the top, and then he hath eaſe and is well. We finde that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe when he was ſicke of his ſin, he could not be quiet, till he had caſt up his ſin to <hi>Moſes, Exod:</hi> 9.27. <hi>And Pharaoh ſent, and called for Moſes and Aaron, and ſaid unto them, I have ſinned this time: the Lord is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and I and my people are wicked.</hi> Nay, he was ſo ſicke of his ſin, that <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be brought in haſt to him, <hi>Exod:</hi> 10.16. <hi>Then Pharaoh cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for Moſes &amp; Aaron in haſt, and he ſaid, I have ſinned againſt the Lord your God, and againſt you:</hi> they muſt be brought Poſt to him, that he might confeſſe his ſin, and eaſe himſelfe, he was ſo troubled and ſo afflicted: of theſe things there is a good and a holy uſe, but when men lay <hi>the foundation</hi> of their comfort upon this confeſſion of ſin, and would draw comfort from hence, and not from Chriſt, this is a <hi>falſe foundation,</hi> and Chriſt is a layd as a foundation in oppoſition to this. Doe but looke how far <hi>Saul</hi> runs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his Iniquitie, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 26.21. <hi>Then ſaid Saul, I have ſinned, returne, my Son David, for I will no more doe thee harme, becauſe my ſoule was pretious in thine eyes this day; Behold, I have playd the foole, and have erred exceedingly.</hi> How doth he confeſſe his ſin? with great indignation he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49133:72"/>calls himſelfe a very foole, and a wretch, <hi>I have playd the foole,</hi> I have been a wicked wretch in what I have done, and yet is but a <hi>Saul</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this: and <hi>Judas,</hi> when his heart ak't, he came and threw downe the ſilver, and ſaith, <hi>I have ſin'd in betraying Innocent blood,</hi> he comes and caſt's up his ſin, and yet but a poore miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Judas,</hi> and he goes and hang's himſelfe; this is not the foundation, Chriſt is a foundation <hi>in oppoſition to this foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is a foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to our ſorrow, mourning, humiliation, faſting, prayers and Teares, and the like:</hi> Some will goe farther than a cleare conviction of ſin, and confeſſing of it to others, they will <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>mourne,</hi> and <hi>ſhed Teares,</hi> and the like; and they thinke becauſe of this, ſurely I am a childe of God, and they lay no <hi>deeper foundation,</hi> they have no <hi>other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> but this, all their comfort, all their joy, and all their hope is laid here, but this is <hi>a falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath;</hi> 1 Kings 2.27. <hi>And it came to paſſe when Ahab heard thoſe words, that he rent his cloath's, and put ſackcloth upon his fleſh, and faſted, and lay in ſackcloth, and went ſoftly.</hi> A king, and yet how doth he humble himſelfe? <hi>Ahab</hi> throw's off his kingly Royall Robes, and puts on Sackcloth and goes ſoftly, yet you ſee what is ſaid of <hi>Ahab, There was none like unto Ahab, that ſold himſelfe to doe wickednes:</hi> he did very abominably in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Idolls, and yet this wretched <hi>Ahab</hi> when the wrath of God comes upon him, and the word of God falls upon his conſcience, he will throw off his Robes and Crowne, and humble himſelfe, and mourne; and yet but an <hi>Ahab</hi> ſtill: And ſo <hi>Saul,</hi> when his conſcience was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49133:73"/>ſmitten <hi>he weepes;</hi> 1 Sam: 24.16. <hi>And it came to paſſe when David had made an end of ſpeaking theſe words unto Saul, that Saul ſaid, is this thy voice, my Son David, and Saul lift up his voice, and wept:</hi> he weepes over his Son <hi>David,</hi> and yet perſecutes his Son <hi>David</hi> againe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this: And ſo <hi>Eſau,</hi> he <hi>found no place for repentance, though he ſought it with Teares;</hi> there's a great deale of difference betwixt <hi>Teares</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> he ſought <hi>repentance,</hi> and he ſought it with <hi>Teares,</hi> yet found no place for it: all theſe things when they come from the <hi>right foundation</hi> are excellent, but otherwiſe they will ſtand men in no ſtead at all. Jeſus Chriſt is a foundation <hi>in oppoſition to this foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Jeſus Chriſt is the onely foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to Reſolutions, Vowes, and Covenants;</hi> that is that which many lay their foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; truly, theſe are wayes which many honeſt hearts have run, they have trac't them through, and there are falſe hearts too, that have run up with them in theſe wayes: when a ſoule is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, afflicted and burdened, he will <hi>reſolve, vow, and Covenant,</hi> I will never doe ſo more, and after that, they have ſome eaſe and are at quiet, and ſo long as they keepe their <hi>Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Vowes, and Covenants,</hi> they are in a good condition as they conclude; ſo it was with <hi>Saul, Returne my Son David, I will ſeeke thy hurt no more,</hi> I will no more perſecute <hi>David,</hi> I will no more walke on in theſe wayes; but afterwards he falls upon him againe and againe, and <hi>David</hi> is forced to fly the land; theſe <hi>Vowes, Reſolutions, and Covenants</hi> will not hold; now Chriſt is a foundation in <hi>oppoſition to this,</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>onely foundation.</hi>

            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49133:73"/>

            <p>Twelfthly, Jeſus Chriſt is a foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to ſome high acts wherein the ſoule puts forth ſeeming ſelfdeniall:</hi> 1 Sam: 10. <hi>Saul</hi> ſhews great ſelfedeniall, when the people come to chooſe him King, <hi>he hides himſelfe;</hi> the men of <hi>Belial</hi> deſpiſed him, and brought him no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, but <hi>he held his peace;</hi> he deny's himſelfe, he takes no notice of their oppoſition &amp; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him; and then afterward in the 11 Chapter, when the people ſaid, <hi>who is he that ſaid, Shall Saul raigne over us? bring the men that we may put them to death.

            <p>Thirteenthly, Jeſus Chriſt is the foundation, <hi>in oppoſition to all holy aymes;</hi> its a moſt bleſſed thing when a man comes to duty's with <hi>holy aymes,</hi> and holy end's, yet if he will lay his <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> here, he may be deceived, its the hardeſt thing in the world for a man to Judge of his <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>aymes; Come,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jehu, and ſee my zeale for the Lord,</hi> he thought he had bleſſed ends and aymes, but laying his <hi>foundation</hi> here, what a falſe bottome had he?

And truly, I doe acknowledge the Lord doth oftentimes make it a ſweete diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Children; when his Children are in great ſtraights, the Lord is pleaſed to come into their ſoules, and reward them in this way, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49133:76"/>yet notwithſtanding we are under a very great miſtake in this, if the Lord be not our light and our guide: We may lay too much upon this, as upon humiliation, or any other duty; ſome ſoules in diſtreſſe, they will open their Bibles, &amp; it may be doe light upon a place that doth ſuite their condition, they thinke this is <hi>a giving in of a word;</hi> I deny not but God doth ſometimes ſpeake a word in this way to his Children in great ſtraights, yet there's a great m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtake in this; the miſtake ly's in this, when that we doe lay more upon the <hi>providence in the giving of the word,</hi> than upon the word it ſelfe, when I beleive not ſo much the word for it ſelfe, as for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; the providence that I ſhould open my booke thus, and light upon ſuch a word, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that I ſhould light upon ſuch a word at ſuch a time; when we eye the providence giving in of the word, more than the word; now note, no providence is the ground of our faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I lay my faith more upon the providence than upon the word, then ſhall I preſently be miſtaken even in this way, which if I had a right underſtanding of, I may have uſe of, and comfort in: let Chriſtians obſerve, its ordinary with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians when they are weak and young, and when they begin to know the Lord, God doth deale with them as with little Children, he traines them up in ſuch a way, and <hi>gives them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular words;</hi> but when ſoules will alway's goe in this way, they may quickly come to Tempt God, and they may come to ſuch a paſſe, as not to care for the word of God in the Scripture, unleſſe it be given in in this way; here we lay <hi>our foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> upon the giving in of a word, lay as much as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49133:77"/>you can upon the word, but take heed of laying too much upon the providence; therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians when they are come to more light and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the Lord would not have them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this way, they muſt not ſtay till the word come to them, but their faith muſt goe out to the word; this way of God with Chriſtians is not the ordinary way when they come to a greater ſtanding. I have a word, ſaith one, ſo given in, in ſuch a remarkable way at ſuch and ſuch a time, and thereupon he lays the <hi>foundation</hi> of his hope, if you lay too much upon this, your faith will be but upon a providence, and this will not be <hi>a ſure foundation,</hi> there may be a great deceit in this, for Satan may give in a word as well as the Lord, a ſoule may take in a word from Satan as well as from the Lord himſelfe; beſides, a word may be given in of the Lord too, and yet this not an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Eternall commition; therefore, when we conclude our Eternall condition from the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in of a word, we erre in this, for this is <hi>no foundation</hi> to it. <hi>Hagar</hi> had an Angel of God from Heaven ſpeaking to her, <hi>Thou God ſeeſt me,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>and have I alſo here looked after him that ſeeth me?</hi> yet ſhe was an out-c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49133:79"/>ſoule comes to this, Lord I am here, I thought I had abundance of things to reſt in, I thought I was ſo rich in my prayers, and ſo rich in my Teares, and ſo rich in my reſolutions and vowes, I had ſuch good fitts in duty's, I had ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous comfort and Joy, but Lord I am brought to this, I am nothing, here the childe of God gets a ſtep beyond the hypocrite, for the hypocrite is never <hi>thoroughly convinc't of righteouſnes,</hi> but when he is convinc't of one peice he goes on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, and when he is beaten off that he creepes on upon another, and he is upon ſome foundation of his owne, but now when the Lord Jeſus comes to take poſſeſſion of a poore ſoule, he beates him off all the peices of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes: if he will reſt upon his confeſſion of ſin and mourning, he will beate him off there; and if he goe higher, to reſolutions, vowes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he beates him off there; and if after this he reſt upon his Reformation, Chriſt will goe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him and beate him off from peice to peice, till he hath wholly conquered the ſoule to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and brought him off of all thoſe falſe grounds and quagmires that the ſoule would have reſted upon and periſhed, till he comes to this thorough conviction of righteouſnes; when they come to great parts, gifts and abilities, Chriſt beates them off of this, till they come to ſettle upon a right foundation, or elſe they will drop off, if they come not up to the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: hence true and faithfull hearts tremble and feare to ſee theſe great ones fall; upon this account ſome aſſert falling away from grace, not conſidering the diſtinction betwixt the old and new Covenant, and the different truth's that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49133:80"/>flow from either, and not ſeeing how the ſame things in appearance flow out of both rootes; when they ſaw the fruit of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> they thought it had been grace, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, they fell from grace; indeed they fall from the grace they had in the firſt Covenant, (a man may looſe all that) but not the grace of the new Covenant, the ſoule that hath it can never fall from that grace, but that ſoule that is partaker of that grace ſhall ſtand for ever; O therefore looke that ye be rooted upon the new Covenant if you would ſtand for ever, that you may be throughly convinced of all your owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as nothing.</p>
            <p>And the Lord brings his people to this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> many times, by <hi>letting them fall by ſome Temptation or Corruption,</hi> and hereby they come to be be beaten off from it: God lets out ſome Temptations or ſome Corruptions, and the ſoule ſtruggles and ſtrives withall its reſolutions and vowes, and all its power, &amp; yet its beaten downe and cannot ſtand, and then the ſoule ſaith, verily there's no hope for me, then the Lord brings it to this, now I ſee I have nothing, I can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Lord thou mighteſt deſtroy me, and tread me underfoote, and if thou wilt doe it I will lye before thee, I have no hope, nor none to turne to; thus the ſoule is <hi>convinc't of righteouſneſs,</hi> and till ſuch time as the ſoule is thus <hi>convinc't of righteouſneſs,</hi> it will never be able to ſtand, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of righteouſnes is the removing the ſoule off all falſe foundation;</hi> the <hi>foundation</hi> of his workes, and the <hi>foundation</hi> of his faith too, as a worke, and the ſoule that hath <hi>no foundation</hi> at all, but onely lookes to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, O be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49133:80"/>thou my foundation. When the Lord hath once brought the ſoule to this, that he hath no foundation in the world, (there is no ſinner in the world, but he hath one foundation or other, he could not beare up elſe, now when the Lord hath brought him to this, that he hath no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the world) Lord, ſaith the convinced ſoule, I have <hi>no foundation</hi> in the world, I hang between earth and heaven, if the Lord bring not Chriſt as <hi>a foundation</hi> to me, I am undone, then is the Lord bringing in his Son Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>a foundation</hi> of the ſoule: O therefore let us looke into our hearts, Profeſſors, Chriſtians, Saints and Brethren, O how have our hearts been rooted? have we not <hi>a foundation</hi> to ſtand upon of our owne? truly the Lord will ſhake us out of all our righteouſnes, whether wrought by the Law or Goſpel, we may be in a miſerable condition: <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a foundation in oppoſition to all falſe foundations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Jeſus Chriſt is the foundation, <hi>in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to true grace it ſelfe:</hi> This conviction of righteouſnes lookes to all the bleſſed graces of the Spirit, <hi>faith, repentance,</hi> and <hi>new obedience,</hi> and <hi>ſelfdeniall,</hi> all theſe things as they flow from the holy Spirit, as they are wrought in us by the Spirit, grow up out of the new Covenant, why of all theſe Chriſt is <hi>the bottome,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>the foundation in oppoſition</hi> unto theſe, theſe are not the foundation: though grace is the moſt bleſſed thing in the world, the moſt bleſſed thing of all, yet its not <hi>the foundation</hi> of our ſoules, but the Lord Jeſus onely, muſt be <hi>the foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O that every ſoule would now looke to Chriſt! O is Chriſt my foundation?</hi> (you had need to look
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49133:81"/>to your hearts, here's much preaching and much profeſſion) it may be I am glorious in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of obedience, and it may be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort too, O but is Chriſt <hi>my foundation,</hi> is Chriſt at <hi>the bottome</hi> of all my comfort? It may be I performe a great many duty's, but is Chriſt <hi>at the bottome</hi> of all my duties? O have I yet the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>the foundation</hi> for my ſoule to looke unto? O Chriſtians, if ever there was a day, now its a day to looke to <hi>your foundation,</hi> when the Lord is ſhaking heaven and earth, even ſhaking the world, and ſhaking it to pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he will yet ſhake more than ever he hath ſhaken, till he hath ſhaken out all the rotten profeſſors that are not founded upon himſelfe; the good Lord make you to looke to <hi>your foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;</hi> what a good thing is it to ſtand firme upon Chriſt? when heaven and earth, and all the things of the world ſhall be ſhaken, yet we ſhall not be ſhaken being upon the <hi>right foundation;</hi> the Lord build all your ſoules upon his Son; if you would be upon <hi>this foundation,</hi> ſay good Lord doe thou come and build, how long have I been building, and how long have I been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but good Lord come thou and build, O that every one of you would but learne thus much, as to goe home and ſay to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Lord come thou and build, good Lord take the worke out of my hands, and build thy ſelfe, I ſhall lay all beſide the foundation, but come and take the worke out of my hand; and if God will come and ſettle us upon his Son, as <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of all, then ſhall we have Joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of glory, then ſhall we Joy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our God, then ſhall we have that comfort
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49133:81"/>and peace which paſſeth all underſtanding, then ſhall our ſoules have heaven begun here, that ſhall laſt to all eternitie; O the Lord build all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>this foundation,</hi> and let no poore ſoule here be diſcouraged, thoſe oftentimes that have leaſt cauſe to be ſhaken are moſt ſhaken, and the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite that hath moſt cauſe, is leaſt ſhaken; poore troubled ſoules, they are apt to be ſhaken when they heare theſe things, but art thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Soule, that thou haſt built upon <hi>a falſe foundation?</hi> do'ſt thou ſay thou art undone for ever, that there is no hope for thee? no, rather ſay bleſſed be the Lord I have ſeene my <hi>falſe bottome,</hi> now I come to the Lord, O Lord doe thou build me, O Lord doe thou take my ſoule into thy hand; the Lord doe this for every poore ſoule here, that you may all who meete here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, meete with the <hi>generall Aſſembly of the firſt-borne, whoſe names are written in heaven,</hi> and then ſhall you not count it in vaine, that you have followed the Lord, and laid <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> not in your ſelves, but in the Son of God, which the Lord Grant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. <hi>Of the Fathers Eternall Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Election is built upon Chriſt, he is the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome ſtone thereof. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49133:82"/>world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love: having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> Chriſt is the firſt of the Fathers Election (if I may ſo ſay) <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold, my ſervant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my ſoule delighteth:</hi> and all others are Elected in him. Hence, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtle concludes, that <hi>the foundation of God ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſure;</hi> that is, Gods decree of Election can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be overturned, it hath ſuch a bottome Stone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> The Covenant of Grace is the moſt bleſſed thing in the world, its the Magazine of faith, Comfort and Holines, a Saints ſtrong Tower of defence againſt all aſſaults. Now Chriſt is the <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of this glorious Covenant of grace; Hence, its ſaid to be made with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3. <hi>I have made a Covenant with my Choſen:</hi> He is called the Mediator of this Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>But now he hath obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;</hi> And Chapter 12.24. <hi>And to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant;</hi> his blood is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the blood of the Covenant, <hi>Zach:</hi> 9.11. <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy Covenant. Heb.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Now the God of peace, that brought againe from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepheard of the ſheepe, through the blood of the Everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Yea, he is called the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelfe, <hi>Iſai:</hi> 42.6. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſnes, and will hold thine hand, and will keepe thee, and give thee for a Covenant of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49133:82"/>the people, for a light of the Gentills.</hi> Chapter 49.8. <hi>I will preſerve thee, and give thee for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the people, to eſtabliſh the earth, to cauſe to inherite the deſolate heritages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Of all the Promiſes of God;</hi> this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes upon the other, if of the Covenant, then of the promiſes; every promiſe is built upon him. Hence obſerve the promiſes ſtill run to Chriſt, the firſt promiſe that ever was made runs to Chriſt, the Womans ſeede; the promiſes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> looke to Chriſt, <hi>Gal:</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to Abraham and his ſeede were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made; he ſaith not, And to ſeeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy ſeede, which is Chriſt.</hi> All the Leviticall Types and ſhaddowes, which were a repreſentation of things to come, did looke to Chriſt, the great Sacrifice. Hence the Apoſtle concludes all the promiſes of God, to be in him, and becauſe in him to be firme and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.20. <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Of all a Saints ſpeciall priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> as,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> 2 Cor: 5.18, 19. <hi>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelfe by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation; To wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe, not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their Treſpaſſes unto them; and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto us the word of Reconciliation.</hi> Rom: 5.10, 11. <hi>For if when we were Enemies, we were Reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much mere being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life; and not onely ſo, but we alſo Joy in God, through
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49133:83"/>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Atonement.</hi> Coll: 1.20, 21, 22. <hi>And (having made peace through the blood of his croſſe) by him to reconcile all things unto himſelfe, by him, I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you that were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your minde by wicked works: yet now hath he reconciled, In the body of his fleſh, through death, to preſent you holy and unblameable, and unreproveable in his ſight.</hi> Reconciliation is twofold. Firſt, Reconciliation <hi>of God to man,</hi> that is made, by giving Juſtice ſatisfaction. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Of man to God,</hi> this is done, by reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans nature; both theſe flow from Chriſt, and are founded upon him; and therefore when Chriſt was peirced, water and blood came forth; blood to ſatisfie divine Juſtice, water to cleanſe and purifie mans nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Effectuall vocation;</hi> Phil: 3.14. <hi>I preſſe toward the Marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Adoption.</hi> Eph: 1.5. <hi>Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to himſelfe, according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will.</hi> Joh: 1.12. <hi>But as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that beleived on his name.</hi> Gal: 4.4, 5. <hi>But when the fulnes of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, To redeeme them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Juſtification;</hi> Chriſt is the bottome Stone of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>But now the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſnes of God without the Law is manifeſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49133:83"/>witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets; Even the righteouſnes of God which is by faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt unto all, and upon them that beleive.</hi> Acts 13.39. <hi>And by him all that beleive are Juſtified from all things, from which yee could be Juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> Iſai. 45.25. <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the ſeede of Iſrael be Juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> Jer. 23.6. <hi>In his dayes Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely: and this is his name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Sanctification;</hi> He is the bottome Stone of it: Hence he is ſaid to be Sanctification to us; 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.30. <hi>But of him are yee in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdome, and righteouſnes, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> The parts of Sanctification are, Mortification, and Vivification; and Chriſt is the foundation of both. Firſt, of Mortification, <hi>Rom:</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> Gal: 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, of Vivification, <hi>Col:</hi> 3.3. <hi>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> John 14.19 <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall alſo live.</hi> Both together are mentioned, <hi>Rom:</hi> 6.5. <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likenes of his death; we ſhall be alſo in the likenes of his Reſurrection.</hi> Phil: 3.10. <hi>That I may know him and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable unto his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Of all ſanctified Gifts and Abilities.</hi> Firſt, outward Abilities, conſider them as they are ſanctified to a man, and not as bare gifts;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49133:84"/>as wiſdome, knowledge, &amp;c. <hi>Col:</hi> 2.3. <hi>In whom are hid all the Treaſures of wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> 1 Cor: 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdome, and righteouſnes, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> Secondly, Inward Abilities, as ſtrength to reſiſt Satans Temptations, our owne Corruptions. <hi>Phil:</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> Iſai. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5.24. <hi>Surely, ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Of Duties and Performances;</hi> Chriſt is the foundation of all theſe: when the people under the Law offered any Sacrifice, they were to bring it to the Prieſt, it muſt goe through his hand, or it could finde no acceptance; hence the office of the high Prieſt, is to offer Gifts and Sacrifices. <hi>Heb:</hi> 5.1. <hi>For every high Prieſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins:</hi> So, all our duty's and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances muſt be brought to Chriſt, and laid upon him, he muſt offer them, he muſt procure the acceptance; that is, the ſtrength by which we performe them, it muſt be his, the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we looke for muſt be his.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Of our Comforts and Enjoyments;</hi> Chriſt is the bottome of all theſe; what ever comforts we have, if they doe not grow upon Chriſt as their Roote, they are nothing. Some plant comfort upon duties, ſome upon enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in duties, ſome upon their affections, &amp;c. but what ever comfort it is, that Chriſt is not the bottome of, it will fade and wither.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Of Graces;</hi> Chriſt is the foundation of all theſe.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:49133:84"/>
               <p> Firſt, Chriſt is the foundation <hi>of our faith;</hi> faith hath no other bottome to ſtand upon, but a crucified Chriſt; there is a faith that is built upon Experience, as that <hi>Pſal:</hi> 106.12, 13. <hi>Then beleived they his words, they ſang his praiſe. They ſoone forgat his workes, they waited not for his Counſell:</hi> but this will not endure, it is fading</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is the foundation <hi>of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour; for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> True repentance flowes out of the wounds of Chriſt. <hi>Zach:</hi> 12.10. <hi>And I will powre upon the houſe of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the ſpirit of grace and of ſupplications, and they ſhall looke upon him whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and they ſhall mourne for him, as one mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his onely Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſſe for him, as one that is in bitterneſſe for his firſt-borne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is the foundation of all <hi>a Saints new obedience.</hi> There is a legall and an Evangelicall obedience; A legall obedience may ſtand upon another bottome; but Evangelicall obedience (which is that we call <hi>new obedience</hi>) is all built upon Chriſt; Evangelicall obedience flowes out of the new Covenant, it being there promiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>And I will put my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and ye ſhall keepe my Judgements, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> them.</hi> And the whole new Covenant (as I have ſaid) is founded upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt:</hi> 4. Who lay's Chriſt as a foundation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw: Not man himſelfe by any act of his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49133:85"/>owne, either his repentance, faith or obedience, but God alone:</hi> The laying Chriſt as a foundation in the ſoule, is ſolely Gods act, and not mans in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe if a man by any act of his could lay Chriſt as a foundation in his ſoule, then ſhould the principall and moſt materiall price in the whole building of our Salvation, be of workes:</hi> But now the building of our Salvation is not of workes but of Grace. <hi>Eph:</hi> 2.5, 8. <hi>Even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt (by grace ye are ſaved) For by grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves: it is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe mans Repentance, bedience, yea, his faith (if it be true) hath Chriſt as its foundation;</hi> therefore cannot it lay Chriſt as a foundation, ſeeing that Chriſt is the foundation of it, and therefore the laying of Chriſt as a foundation is before it. And indeed its a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notion among Divines, That a man in the firſt worke is meerely Paſſive, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a childe when firſt conceived and formed in the wombe is meerely paſſive, it doth nothing; ſo its with a Soule in the firſt worke, it therefore doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in laying Chriſt as a foundation, but Chriſt is firſt by the father laid as a foundation in the ſoule, and then the ſoule Acts, it beleives, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, it obey's, &amp;c. And indeed, its a thing Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceive, that man by any act of his, either his faith, repentance, obedience, &amp;c. ſhould lay Chriſt as a foundation, ſeeing the creature is a finite thing, and all his acts are like himſelfe finite, but Chriſt is the Infinite God; now how can a finite hand or power moove an
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49133:85"/>Infinite thing? how can that which is finite bring downe that which is Infinite, and lay it as <hi>a foundation;</hi> the laying Chriſt therefore as <hi>a foundation,</hi> is not the act of the creature, but of God onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt:</hi> 5. But how doth God lay Chriſt as a foundation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> 1. <hi>By razing all other foundations:</hi> one ſoule (as I ſaid before) builds upon his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal convictions, mournings, humiliations; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his reſolutions, vowes, Covenants, his acts of revenge upon himſelfe, his reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,  Another, on his Joyes, Comforts, his diſpoſition of heart that ſometimes he finds to a duty, and his ſincere aymes (as he thinkes) therein; Another upon his particular words gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in, ſometimes to beare him up under ſtraits's, ſometimes to encourage to his duty, and upon his faith in theſe, &amp;c. Now when God comes indeed to lay Chriſt as <hi>a foundation</hi> in any ſoule, if a ſoule have <hi>ſuch foundations.</hi> God will ſhake them all, yea raze them to the ground: So that now the ſoule will ſee and ſay, my convictions, mournings, humiliations, reſolutions, vowes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, acts of ſelfe-revenge, reformations are nothing, nothing as to evidence Gods love to my ſoule, I may be miſerable, periſh, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever, notwithſtanding this; my privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Church-ſhip, participation of ordinances, are nothing; I may be a caſt-out for ever, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe my comforts, joyes, good fits to duty, good aymes therein (as I thinke) are nothing, as to build any hope here, for I may be deceived and gull'd in all theſe, and periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally notwithſtanding theſe; my words given in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49133:86"/>in ſtraights, when I have been going to ſome worke, and my faith laid upon theſe, are nothing as to aſſure me God is my father, I may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a miſtake in all theſe. Now! is the ſoule ſtripped bare, and naked, and become truly poore in ſpirit; for whereas before it thought it ſelfe rich, and had many things, convictions, humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vowes, reformations, comforts, joyes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular words, faith in theſe, which it could mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up, as evidences of Gods love to it, now it ſees it hath nothing at all, it cannot bring forth one thing, that can evidence to it, it is a childe of God, or got beyond the hypocrite. And now it lies, Lord a Chriſt or nothing, a naked Chriſt or nothing; I have tryed <hi>all foundations,</hi> &amp; now they are nothing, they are all ſhaken to pieces, razed to the ground. Thus the ſoule hang's (as 'twere) betwixt Earth and heaven, or Hell and heaven rather, not knowing what will become of him, but a little glimpſe he hath that Chriſt can ſave him yet, and ſome inward groanings there are, O Chriſt or nothing, Chriſt now to be my Comfort, my wiſdome, my righteouſnes, my ſanctification, &amp;c or nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>By making an Inward diſcovery to the ſoule, that all that which it hath ſought to the Law for, is laid up in Chriſtonely, and to be had from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Now the ſoule ſees, that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ran to the Law, for conviction of ſin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, obedience, faith, Comfort, &amp;c. that all this is treaſured up richly in Jeſus Chriſt, and it muſt have theſe things (if it will have the true, and not be put off with counterfeit ware) from Jeſus Chriſt onely: now the ſoule begins to looke after a new conviction of ſin, repentance, ſaith,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49133:86"/>obedience, Comfort, &amp;c. And whereas it thought before that it had all theſe, now, indeed it ſees it had them not, what it had was onely counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite ware, the true ware being to be had onely from Chriſt, out of his warehouſe; now it cry's Lord give me the wiſdome of Chriſt, the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Chriſt, that faith, that repentance, obedience, Comfort, that is in Chriſt, and flow's from him: now begins Chriſt to be all, and there is nothing that hath any credit with the ſoule, but what is Chriſts, it cares not for repentance, faith, Comfort, &amp;c. if it be not Chriſts. But as before, it ſaid I am nothing, my convictions, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, reformation, comfort, faith, &amp;c. are nothing; now it ſaith otherwiſe, Chriſt is all, Chriſt is my wiſdome, my righteouſnes, my ſanctification, my repentance, my faith, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, my obedience, my ſtrength to ſtand, &amp;c. that is, I looke for all theſe no where but in and from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>By enabling the ſoule, to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect actuall cloſe with Chriſt for all theſe.</hi> This is that coming which followes the drawing, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, learning of the father; <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>No man can come to me, except the father which hath ſent me, draw him: Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the father, cometh unto me.</hi> But note, that this latter is not ſo properly laying of the <hi>foundation,</hi> for the <hi>foundation</hi> is laid in the two former, as the uniting of the ſoule to the foundation, or the ſoddering of the ſoule and foundation, Cementing them into one, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſpirituall growth and fruitfulnes, for the foundation Chriſt, being by the father planted in the ſoule, his wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49133:87"/>&amp;c. being laid at the very bottome of all; it is neceſſary that now to the end, that this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, grace, holines, &amp;c. might ſhoot up into the ſoule, and cauſe the glorious buddings forth of Goſpel light, grace, and holines in it, that there ſhould be a ſoddering of the ſoule and the foundation; for as the tender graft partakes of the ſap that is in the ſtocke, by ſuch a union with the ſtocke, as makes the graft and ſtocke grow into one; ſo the participation of that light, life, grace, Righteouſnes, Holines, of which (the bleſſed <hi>foundation</hi>) Chriſt is full, is conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule, by ſuch a knitting of this <hi>foundation</hi> and the ſoule together, as makes them inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly one: now! flowes up out of the <hi>foundation,</hi> that wiſdome, grace, Holines, that is in it, into the ſoule, and the ſoule which before was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of all, and had the ſap of old <hi>Adam,</hi> (that wiſdome, righteouſnes, holines, &amp;c. which ſprings from old <hi>Adam</hi>) let out, hath the new <hi>Adam</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up his living ſap into it, and now the ſoules faith, repentance, obedience, &amp;c. are all ſuch as this new ſap ſends forth, that is, it is all grace of another kinde, its faith is of another kind to what before it had, its repentance and obedience is of another kind, its comforts are of another kind. And this God brings all his to, before ever they become fruitfull in a Goſpel way; for note here, it may be the condition of a true childe of God, as well as of the hypocrite, to build too much upon <hi>theſe foundations,</hi> yea to be building yeares together upon them, and that too, after true grace is wrought in his ſoule: <hi>Abraham</hi> was a true beleiver, and yet goes in unto <hi>Hagar</hi> the old Covenant, and thirteene yeares together his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49133:87"/>heart run's upon her fruit, and all his Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are from it; But note this withall, that till God brings a belever to this, to make a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and Immediate cloſe with Chriſt, in the new Covenant, he will be barren as to Goſpel fruit: <hi>Abraham</hi> had no fruit from <hi>Sarah,</hi> till God had diſcovered to him, that <hi>Hagar's</hi> fruit was not the fruit, but he muſt yet looke for fruit from <hi>Sarah;</hi> ſo, a true beleiver will be barren as to Goſpel fruit, untill he is brought off from all <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundations,</hi> and made to cloſe with Chriſt in the new Covenant. And indeed I thinke I may ſay, that there never was a beleiver in the world, but either before converſion or after, he hath been brought under the old Covenant, and there hath been a building upon <hi>ſuch foundations,</hi> for it is naturall to a ſoule under the old Covenant ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt:</hi> 6. But when doth God lay Chriſt as a foundation in the ſoule, is it in the firſt worke or change that is wrought upon a ſoule, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> There is a twofold worke or change wrought upon many ſoules; I ſay many, becauſe every one doth not paſſe under this double change.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Legall,</hi> which is a worke or change wrought by the power of the Law, or by the Miniſtry of the letter; for ſo the Apoſtle calls the Law, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the new Teſtament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giveth life.</hi> And I doe here expound the Law by the Miniſtry of the letter, to the end, we may not looke upon the Law, as containing onely
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49133:88"/>the matter of the ten Commandements, and the promiſes and Threats annexed to theſe; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, take the Law at large for the ſumme of that truth revealed, either in the Scriptures of the old or New Teſtament, which containes within it, Doctrines, Promiſes, Precepts, Threats, &amp;c. ſo far as this truth comes to a ſoule, and is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved onely as a notion, as it is the letter, a voice of words, &amp;c. ſo far it falls ſhort of being Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is a word of Power, the Power of God unto Salvation, a Miniſtration of the Spirit and life, and is no other but the word of the Law, that is, a bare word without Power, a killing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to it: And whatſoever worke or change, is wrought by this word, as it comes to the ſoule onely as an enlightening notion, or directing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diſcovering to a man his duty, ſtate, &amp;c. or as it comes as a threatening terrifying voice of words, driving the ſoule to that it apprehends to be its duty, and making it for feare to ſeeke after a better ſtate than it ſees it ſelfe to be in, (for all this the word as its a bare letter, or a voice of words may doe) I ſay, all this worke or change is no other nor better than a <hi>legall worke</hi> or change; for it is a worke wrought by the Miniſtry of the letter, by a voice of words, it is the light of the bare letter, and the terror of the voice of words, that makes a man in his owne ſtrength fall to working, and accordingly the worke brought forth, or the change produced hereby, ſeeing it is no other, but an act, a worke, a change, performed by the ſtrength of nature, and not by the ſtrength of the promiſe, it can be no other, but a worke of the fleſh, a child of the Law (or old Covenant) as was <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49133:88"/>not of the promiſe (or new Covenant) as was <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is an Evangelicall worke</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> change, which is, that worke which is wrought upon the ſoule by the power of the Spirit in the word, cutting the ſoule off from the dead ſtock of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and ingraffing it into the living ſtock of the new <hi>Adam</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; And the very foundation of the worke or change is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-union with Chriſt. The Spirit of God in the Word lays hold of a poore ſoule by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, and breakes it off from the old ſtock, and in the ſame Inſtant ingraffs it into Chriſt; Now by the engraffing there is a union, and from this union a communication to the ſoule of that new ſap and life that is in Chriſt, and by virtue of this a glorious work and change is wrought in the ſoule, new fruit, new actions appeare in it.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve the Fathers laying Chriſt as a foundation is not in the firſt worke, which I call <hi>Legal,</hi> for a ſoule may have that work, as had <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, Judas, Herod, Stony &amp; Thorny ground,</hi> &amp;c. and yet periſh for ever, but ſo cannot any that Chriſt is the foundation of, for if ſo, then could not Chriſt be <hi>a ſure foundation,</hi> as the Prophet calls him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.16. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Syon for a foundation, a Stone, a tryed ſtone, a precious corner Stone, a ſure foundation:</hi> But the laying of Chriſt as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in this <hi>ſecond worke;</hi> And the beginning of this is our union, which is that thing by which we are ingraffed into Chriſt, and ſo grow and beare fruit upon Chriſt, as the <hi>ſtock or foundation;</hi> when a ſoule hath this union, from that moment
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49133:89"/>is Chriſt his foundation, but not before; for what ever may be found in him, or come from him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this union, be it ſorrow for ſin, Comfort, obedience, &amp;c. it hath not Chriſt for <hi>a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for how can Chriſt be <hi>a foundation</hi> to that ſoule, or to any thing in that ſoule, that is not united to him? can we ſay ſuch a thing is <hi>a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> to ſuch a building, and yet the building be ſeparate from that thing, and ſtanding upon ſomething elſe? not ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt:</hi> But the ſoule may ſay, If there be this double worke, and change; and Chriſt is the foundation onely of the latter, How ſhall I know whether the worke upon me be Legal or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, that ſo, I may know whether Chriſt be <hi>my foundation,</hi> yea or no?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ:</hi> This is a moſt difficult Queſtion, and the farther I conſider it, the more doth it beget matter of feare and trembling; and the rather becauſe thoſe things which we ordinarily bring forth as evidences of the grace of God within us will not manifeſt this difference, becauſe there is not any one particular worke, affection, grace, that flowes from the <hi>Goſpel-worke</hi> upon a ſoule, but that worke which is onely <hi>Legall,</hi> hath the counterfeit of that worke, grace, affection, &amp;c. not but that there is a reall difference betwixt thoſe fruits of Sanctification that ſpring from the Law, and thoſe that come from the Spirit in the Goſpel, but in regard the Legall worke hath the counterfeite of what ever the other hath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſcerning of the true from the falſe and counterfeite, is a moſt hard thing. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Doth the Goſpel-worke cauſe ſorrow for ſin, ſo doth the Legall too:</hi> The Terrors of the old
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49133:89"/>Covenant made <hi>Ahab</hi> mourne, <hi>Judas</hi> repent, &amp;c. As the Goſpel worke, may make the heart ſoft, diſſolve it into teares, ſo may the Legall too, diſſolve the heart into teares, ſoften it greatly for a while.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Doth the Goſpel worke produce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, make a ſoule run to God upon his knees day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo may the Legal too.</hi> Iſai. 58.2. <hi>Yet they ſeeke me dayly, and delight to know my wayes, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that did righteouſnes, and forſooke not the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of their God; They aske of me the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Juſtice; they take delight in approaching to God. Iſhmael</hi> was a praying child, <hi>God heard the voice of the Lad.</hi> Secondly, for Reformation, <hi>Doth the Goſpel work cauſe that? ſo may the Legall too;</hi> what did <hi>Herod?</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Doth the Goſpel worke produce grace? ſo may the Legall too,</hi> though not true grace, yet grace like the true. Firſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. See before. Secondly, for ſelfdeniall. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhewed a great example of ſelfdeniall. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.9. <hi>And his ſons Iſaac and Iſhmael buried him in the Cave of Machpelah,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.12, 13. <hi>And the people ſaid unto Samuel, who is he that ſaid, ſhall Saul raigne over us? bring the men that we may put them to death. And Saul ſaid, there ſhall not a man be put to death this day.</hi> Thirdly, for delighting in holy duties, in the wayes and ordinances of God. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.2. <hi>Yet they ſeeke me dayly, and delight to know my wayes,</hi> &amp;c. Fourthly, for zeale for God, and his wayes, <hi>Paul</hi> before converſion was full of zeale; and the Jewes, <hi>Rom:</hi> 10.2. <hi>For I beare them record, that they have a zeale for God, but not according to knowledge.</hi> Fifthly, for faith. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12, 13, 14. <hi>Then beleived they his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49133:90"/>words, they ſang his praiſe. They ſoone forgat his works, they waited not for his Counſell: But luſted exceedingly in the wildernes, and tempted God in the deſert</hi> Iſai 48.1, 2. <hi>Heare yee this, O houſe of Jacob, which are called by the name of Iſrael, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; which ſweare by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Iſrael, but not in Truth, nor in Righteouſnes, for they call themſelves of the holy Citty, and they ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the Lord of Hoſts is his name.</hi> For there is a faith of the Law as well as of the Goſpel, ſo long as a man can obey and performe the condition, the Law will give him a faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Doth the Goſpel worke bring a man into Relation to God and Chriſt? ſo may the Legall too, into ſome kinde of relation.</hi> Jer: 31.32. <hi>Not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt, (which my Covenant they brake, although I was an Husband unto them, ſaith the Lord).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Doth the Goſpel worke beget peace and Comfort? ſo may the Legal too;</hi> for obſerve, ſo far as by the legal worke, a faith may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and ſome kind of relation held forth in that worke, ſo far there will be peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Doth the Goſpel worke, make a man to abandon all his ſhelters in himſelfe, and fly for refuge to Jeſus Chriſt, and the Covenant of grace? So there may be ſomething like that in the legall worke alſo;</hi> for marke it, A ſoule by the light of truth, being throughly convinced that all his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, obedience, his faith, Comfort, &amp;c. that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49133:90"/>ſprung from the Law is nothing, and that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely to be had in the Covenant of grace, and a naked Chriſt held forth therein, may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon quit his truſt and reliance in theſe, and now run in his owne ſtrength (as before he did to the Law, ſo now) to the Covenant of grace, and to a naked Chriſt for refuge. I ſay, in his owne ſtrengtſt ſtill. As a man when the flood was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, might have hung upon the outſide of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and yet have periſhed, ſo a man may run thus far in his owne ſtrength, and hang upon the outſide of Chriſt (as it were) and yet periſh. And yet all this (though what a man runs to is the Goſpel, yet) no more than <hi>a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal worke,</hi> a worke performed in a mans owne ſtrength, and not in the ſtrength of Chriſt; for note, as a true Goſpel Saint doth Evangelize the Law, that is, he goes to the Law, labours to obey that in Goſpel-ſtrength, the ſtrength of Chriſt: So a Legaliſt may legalize the very Goſpel, that is, take hold of Chriſt the Covenant of grace, cloſe with Goſpel principles in his own ſtrength. When he is convinced he is a miſerable ſinner, and that his repentance, his reformation, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, his faith, &amp;c. that ſprings from the Law cannot redeeme him, but his onely remedy is in Chriſt and grace, he may run to that, and hang upon Goſpel notions and principles for helpe. Nay, he may not onely run to theſe but attaine ſome fruit; hence</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>He may attaine ſome kinde of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which it may be he could not attaine by the power of the Law. 2 Pet. 2.20. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord &amp; Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49133:91"/>they are againe entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> And <hi>Heb:</hi> 10.29. <hi>Of how much ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath treden underfoote the Sen of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, <hi>He may have ſome kind of taſt of ſweetneſs even in Chriſt himſelfe.</hi> Heb. 6.4. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy-Gheſt.</hi> The heavenly gift is Chriſt himſelfe: <hi>John</hi> 6.32, 33. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread from heaven, but my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth you the true bread from heaven, for the bread of God is he which cometh downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and giveth life unto the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He may in a kinde be made a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Spirit.</hi> Heb. 6.4. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> that is, he may have common light, and common aſſiſtance, which though it is not ſaving, yet it may be ſuch light and ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance as may be from the Spirit, ſuch as he hath not in himſelfe, light into truth, beyond what he can attaine meerely by his reaſon and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He may taſt a ſweetneſs in the word of Chriſt, ſo far as he may ſay, O it is a good word.</hi> Heb. 6.5. <hi>And have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. <hi>But he that received the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it.</hi> The ſeed in Stony places heares the word, and with joy receives it. But what word is this which makes the heart joy againe? why the word of the kingdome, ver 10. <hi>When any one heareth the word of the kingdome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſowen in his heart, this is he which received ſeed by the wayes ſide,</hi> and that is the Goſpel word, not that of the law. Such an effect therefore may the very Goſpel word beget in men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>He may (as to flaſhes) at ſometimes feele ſomething of the joyes that are above;</hi> his heart may have ſome kinde of ſudden Raviſhments with the Joyes of heaven, as though they were his: <hi>Heb:</hi> 6.5. <hi>And have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come:</hi> all this may be in a man, who as yet is without union with Chriſt, who as yet hath no more worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him than what he hath attained by his owne ſtrength; firſt running in his owne ſtrength to the Law, and finding no helpe there, may then
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49133:92"/>run in his owne ſtrength to the Goſpel, and then conceiving becauſe now he is got off from the Law, and hath ſeene the emptines of all his legall truſts &amp; reſts, and hath got ſome light into Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel truths, and hangs as he thinkes upon Chriſt and the Covenant of grace onely, though yet all this his hanging is but an act of his own, a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the outſide of the Arke, he judgeth that though his condition was bad before, yet now it muſt needs be good, and from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of himſelfe he is it may be holpen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to reforme, finds ſweetnes in thoughts of Chriſt, becauſe he thinkes he hath now layd hold on him, and Chriſt muſt needs be his; he hath Joy in hearing Goſpel truths, and feels at a fit as 'twere a kind of heavenly Joyes in himſelfe, and yet for all this in old <hi>

               <p>Hence it is, ſeeing many that attaine all theſe things fall away in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>race;</hi> for indeed what can be more like grace than the aforeſaid things? but yet their Poſition is falſe, and ariſeth from the not diſtinguiſhing of <hi>workes Legall,</hi> from <hi>workes Goſpell;</hi> what ever may be in man by vertue of a legall worke, that is, a worke wrought in a man, either by legall Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or by legall ſtrength, working upon Goſpel principles; all that, a man may fall from, becauſe all that may be, and the ſoule not upon the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Chriſt, and therefore the building may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49133:92"/>fall. What ever a man comes by, either by old Covenant light, or by old Covenant ſtrength, all that he may looſe, for the old Covenant is a fading thing; 'tis ſuch a Covenant as may be broken, <hi>Heb:</hi> 8.9 <hi>Not according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I made with their fathers, in the day when I tooke them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt, becauſe they continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And though God by vertue of that Covenant ſtands in ſome kind of relation (as I have ſaid) to perſons under it, yet ſuch is the Tenour of that Covenant, that if they doe not keepe Covenant, but rebell, God will caſt them off, and not regard them for all that, and therefore the Apoſtle, for thoſe words in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> although <hi>I was an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to them,</hi> reads, <hi>and I regarded them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſo much ſeeming grace may be in a man by vertue of old Covenant light, or old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtrength, acting upon Goſpel light and principles; that it is the moſt difficult thing in the world to diſtinguiſh it from true grace, therefore ſo many that ſeemed to have true grace fall away, and then men when they ſee it, and finde Caveats in the word, to perſons going far upon Goſpel principles, to take heed leaſt they fall away. Conclude, <hi>men may fall away,</hi> which indeed is falſe, for no ſoule truly in Chriſt, can ever fall, but perſons may run thus far, and yet ſtill in the Stock of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſuch may fall.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo ſome conclude falſely <hi>free-will,</hi> not diſtinguiſhing betwixt workes flowing from Legall light and ſtrength, and that flow from Goſpel light and ſtrength. To the firſt, man hath
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49133:93"/>a power, and by his owne ſtrength doth all, and becauſe many goe ſo farre in that ſtrength which they feele to be their owne, as that they thinke themſelves to have true grace, and to be living members of Chriſt, (which as indeed it is not ſo) hence they conclude man hath a power &amp; a will in himſelfe to receive Chriſt, which is not ſo; man hath a power to repent, obey, believe, in a legall way, and he hath a power to lay hold on Chriſt as tendered in the Covenant of grace, in ſuch manner as a man may be ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Queſt:</hi> But you will ſay, if a man by Legal Principles, and Legal ſtrength, may goe thus far, wherein lyes the difference betwixt the true Saint, and this ſeeming Saint?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An: The maine and eſſentiall difference ly's here, in the roote, the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd the other grow's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The ſeeming Saint may have many glorious things, but the roote upon which all he hath or doth, ſtand's, is the old <hi>Adam;</hi> The true Saint perhaps may have fewer and leſſe glorious bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches than the other, but the roote of what he hath or doth, is the new <hi>Adam.</hi> So that in a word, it is the ſoules union with Chriſt as <hi>the roote,</hi> the foundation of all that he hath or doth, wherein ly's the <hi>very foundation</hi> of this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I ſay, all ly's here, in our having or not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly there is many a gratious ſoule, that never in all his life time attaines ſo much as what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49133:93"/>we have ſhewed may be in the ſeeming Saint, and yet for all that he ſtands for ever, and all the Power of Hell ſhall never be able to ſhake him; and the other which hath more glorious bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, will fall at one time or other. The reaſon is, becauſe the firſt, though the branches be the leſſe, and leſſe glorious to outward appearance, yet having this true union with Chriſt, grow's upon this ſound roote, that can never decay; the other though the branches may be greater, yet ſtands upon a rotten Roote. As you may ſee two Trees, one hath great Limbes and branches, and makes a great ſpreading, and for the preſent is very greene, onely there is ſome rottennes at the roote; the other hath but ſmall branches, and is not outwardly halfe ſo glorious, but hath a firme ſound roote; Now of theſe two, the great Tree, though he make a greater ſhew &amp; ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of branches, yet becauſe there is rottenneſſe at the roote, he will not retaine his greenneſſe, but is in a decaying ſtate, and in time the leaves fall, the branches wither, &amp; the whole tree dyes; but the leſſer Tree, though he is not comparable to the other in bignes and multitude of branches, nay, perhaps never comes to have ſo many ſpreading bough's, yet becauſe he is ſound at roote, he ſtill grow's, retaines his greenneſſe, and his fruite (unleſſe in ſome winter ſeaſons) and never rotts: So, therefore let no poore ſoule thinke with himſelfe, I cannot be ſincere, becauſe I have never yet gone ſo far, as thoſe have done and doe that fall away; it may be ſoule, thou never ſhalt in thy life, and yet thy condition may be good, and thou ſhalt ſtand for ever, when the other ſhall rot and periſh, if thou art
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49133:94"/>upon the right roote, and that little thou haſt grow upon that roote, that is, if thou haſt union with Chriſt the new <hi>Adam,</hi> and thy branches ſpring thence. For here (I ſay) in this union ly's the difference. Whence we may all learne, that of all things in the world its moſt neceſſary that we mind this union; and if we would know ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the goodneſſe of our ſtate, or the worth of any thing we either doe or have, we muſt labour to find out what is the roote of all, and whither or no, what we have or doe, ſpring from Chriſt as the roote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know whether Chriſt be my roote, and what I have and doe ſpring from him as the roote?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> The beſt Evidence that I am able to give is this; <hi>If Chriſt be thy roote, then wilt thou ſenſibly perceive that thou haſt nothing at all, no wiſdome, no ſtrength, righteouſneſs, holineſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but what ſprings from the roote:</hi> if we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a thing as a Tree to have ſenſe, we might alſo conceive that the Tree would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſenſible of this, that it hath no ſap nor moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture but what comes from the roote, nor could it put forth branch, leafe or fruit, were its roote taken from it. So if Chriſt be the roote, the ſoule will be really ſenſible of this, nothing more, that I have no wiſdome, ſtrength, &amp;c. nothing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my ſelfe but what comes from Chriſt; it will (I may ſay) as ſenſibly feele its ſtrength, and all it hath coming up from Chriſt, as a Tree had it ſenſe would feele the ſhooting up of the ſap through the body of it, into its boughes, branches and fruit.</p>
               <p>But now becauſe there may be a great deceit
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49133:94"/>here, and our wicked hearts are ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deceive themſelves, therefore mind theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is a difference betwixt the acknowledging Chriſt to be our all, and the feeling of this.</hi> There is no Proteſtant but upon his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples muſt confeſſe it, but there are but few that feele it, and a man never comes to feele it, till firſt he is brought to this, that he cannot feele ſtrength, holineſs, &amp;c in any thing in the world elſe, for ſo long as a man can feele ſtrength and helpe any where elſe, he doth not feele Chriſt as his ſtrength and helpe, if he be convinced he is miſerable, if he can but feele ſuch a thing as this in himſelfe, I can repent, mourne, reforme, &amp;c. he reſts there, and comes not to feele Chriſt his ſtrength; if he ſee an emptines in theſe things, if now he can but feele a power to goe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive the promiſe, hang upon Chriſt in a general way, he reſts there, if he cannot feele this, but finds clearly that as his repentance, yea his faith, is but a thing of his owne and nothing, if now he can but feele a power in himſelfe to goe and pray to God to give him the true faith &amp; repentance, 'tis a hundred to one if he reſt not there. So long as he feeles any thing in himſelfe, he feeles not Chriſt as all. But now when God brings a ſoule to feele Chriſt indeed as his roote, he is made firſt as really to feele as ever he felt any thing in the world that he hath nothing, feeles that he hath not one holy groane, cannot ſhed one true teare, cannot believe, nay cannot in himſelfe wait upon God that would give him faith, &amp;c. when he is thus and hath no feeling in himſelfe, then he feeles ſenſibly a flowing of wiſdome, ſtrength,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49133:95"/>holineſs from another, ſo as that now he can ſay, this ſtrength, this holineſs, &amp;c. is verily none of my owne, and I am nothing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a difference betwixt cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, and thereby getting ſome of his ſap, as I may ſo ſay from him, &amp; being united to Chriſt as my very and onely roote.</hi> As for Inſtance, the Ivie you know clings to the Oake, and thereby getts ſome of the ſap, by which it is nouriſhed in part, but it hath a roote of its owne, the roote of the Oake is not it roote. Now becauſe it wants the firme roote of the Oake, and hath but a weake roote of its owne, thence it comes to paſſe, that notwithſtanding it getts ſome moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture from the Oake by clinging to the outſide of it, and hath ſome ſap alſo from its owne roote, yet it is very ſubject to wither and dyes whilſt the Oake lives. So it may be with a Legall ſoule, as what hath been already ſaid makes appeare, he hath a roote of his owne, the roote of old <hi>Adam,</hi> but finding himſelfe notwithſtanding this roote to be but a withering branch, he may by that ſtrength that is given him from this roote, cling to Chriſt the living Oake, hang upon him in an outward way, as the Ivie hangs on the barke the outſide of the Oake, hereby he may get as well ſome ſap from Chriſt whilſt he thus hangs upon him in an outward way, as may ſomewhat helpe to make him greene, keeping life in him for a time, as doth the ſap he hath from his owne roote; and hereby his life is partly from his owne roote, which affords him ſo much ſap as gives him ſtrength to cling to this living Oake, and partly from that ſap which by cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49133:95"/>to Chriſt in an outward way he draw's from him. Yet becauſe this ſoule hath not Chriſt for his roote, but what nouriſhment he getts from him is onely in an outward way, by an outward cleaving to him, &amp; clinging about him, to which he is aſſiſted and enabled by that ſtrength that is afforded him from his owne roote, the old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Hence it comes to paſſe, that at one time or other, this cleaving ſoule which receives not his ſtrength, life, nouriſhment from Chriſt by vertue of a reall union with Chriſt as his roote, but by vertue of an outward cleaving and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Chriſt doth dye and wither, therefore I ſay, a difference there is betwixt clinging to Chriſt, and thereby ſucking for a time ſome ſap from him, and union, clinging is not union, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the coming of ſap that way the ſame with that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p that comes by vertue of the union of the Tree; the ſap the Ivie getts is forced from the Oake into it ſelfe by clinging about it, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſucking, but now the ſap that comes from the roote into the Tree, that aſcends in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way. So where union is with Chriſt as the roote, the ſoules feeles the ſap its ſtrength, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp;c. flowing into it from Chriſt in a ſecret, yet wonderfull naturall way, ſo that it flow's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it without the ſoules ſtriving and ſtruggling to force this ſap to its ſelfe, but it comes in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall way, it flow's up ſecretly, and in a manner indiſcernably into it, the ſoule begins to feele it ſelfe full of ſap, but knowes not how it was filled hardly, now this being come into it, then it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this ſoule to put forth dayly new branches, leaves, buds, and fruit; but where it is otherwiſe, though ſap may be had from Chriſt, yet it is but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49133:96"/>a forced thing, a thing extorted by outward clinging, and as the Ivie when its owne roote doth not afford it ſufficient ſap to make it cling to the Oakes, dyes; ſo this ſoule when its owne ſtrength, the ſtrength received from old <hi>Adam;</hi> by which it clings to Chriſt in an outward way ſhall faile it, that it can cling no longer, it will dye and wither, notwithſtanding for ſome time whilſt its owne ſtrength ſerved it to cling cloſe, it did receive a kinde of life and nouriſhment from him.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It's the promiſe of the Father, becauſe of the times and ſeaſons of the giving out of this promiſe;</hi> for the times and ſeaſons are in the hands of the Father, ſo Chriſt tells his Diſciples in this Chapter, <hi>But the Father hath kept them in his owne power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The maine reaſon is, <hi>That hereby Chriſt might ſtrengthen and confirme the faith of his Diſciples and Children in waiting for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> we have need of all that can be to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, and therefore Chriſt calls it the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49133:98"/>promiſe of the Father; the Diſciples might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ô is the Father willing we ſhould have the Spirit? we know how willing Chriſt is, he hath ſaid he will ſend us a Comforter, we are ſure we ſhall want nothing that Chriſt can doe for us, but is the Fathers heart as free to give out the Spirit, when Chriſt comes to heaven will not the Father hinder it? Chriſt therefore entitles it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the promiſe of the Father than his owne; as if he ſhould have ſaid, doe not thinke poore ſoules, that my Father is unwilling to give out his Spirit, that he is an Enemy to your peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort &amp; Joy, or the coming of the Spirit of grace; no, the Fathers heart is as full and as free, as you can conceive mine to be, for its the promiſe of the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt:</hi> 2. But why doth Chriſt pitch the faith of his Diſciples now at the time of his aſcenſion upon this promiſe, rather than upon any other? could he not bid them as well to waite for ſome other promiſe as for this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe there was no promiſe ſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the ſtate and condition, that the people of Chriſt, the Diſciples of Chriſt, his followers were now come into, as this promiſe:</hi> no promiſe is ſo ſuitable to a poore ſoule in the time of Chriſts abſence, as the promiſe of the Spirit; Chriſt had been perſonally preſent with his Diſciples ſome time, and he had comforted, cheered, warm'd and quickened them, and when his perſonall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was to leave them, no promiſe could be ſo ſweete, comfortable, and acceptable to anſwer their condition, as this promiſe of the Spirit, therefore Chriſt gives them this promiſe as moſt ſuiting them; if any thing could hold them up
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49133:99"/>againſt the rage of the world, and the malice of the Devill now in his abſence, it would be the promiſe of the Father, therefore it was the moſt ſuitable promiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe this promiſe, it was now in the very nicke of fulfilling;</hi> The promiſe was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, but now the very time of fulfilling of it was at hand, the time of giving out of more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit was drawing on; now, its the way of God with his Children, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is upon the nick of fulfilling then will God be putting on his Children in a more eſpeciall manner to be waiting, and ſeeking, and looking up to him, even for the fulfilling of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: Therefore when the ſeventy yeares Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> was run out, then God ſtirr'd up the heart of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and he falls downe before God and prayes, and urges the promiſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives; when the time was even expired, when God comes to give forth his promiſe, when the fulfilling time is come, then God puts his people upon waiting for it: So afterwards, when <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was to be built, when the time of fulfilling was come, then the Lord wonderfully ſtirr's up the heart of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and he falls downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, crying, <hi>O that Jeruſalem might be no more a Citty without walls:</hi> and indeed its a great argument, (though not a demonſtration to convince men, yet) its ſuch an argument as carry's much weight in it to the hearts of the Children of God, when they are put on in a more ſpeciall manner to waite upon God, for the fulfilling of this or that particular promiſe, for the doing of this or that particular worke, though the times and ſeaſons are many times
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49133:99"/>hid to us, yet they are in the Fathers power, and they are all knowne to him, and when they draw nigh, God doth uſually make that worke to run over the heart of his Children, and ſets them a praying, and ſeeking, and beleiving, and waiting for that worke; and it may be they can hardly tell how it comes to paſſe that they are ſo put upon it, but it comes from a ſecret way of Gods diſpenſation towards his Children, when God ſees that the worke is ripe, and the thing is heare at hand, that it may come when his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are in a waiting poſture, he will forerun it over the hearts of his Children ere he bring it viſibly forth before the world. But though this be a real truth, yet I doe not take it to be the ſpeciall reaſon here, why Chriſt doth put them to looke for the fulfilling of this promiſe, rather than any other, but the chiefe reaſon I take to be this;</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe the promiſe of the Spirit its the great promiſe, that the Saints and peaple of God in the new Teſtament dayes are to have their eye fixed upon, and are to be found waiting upon God continually for the giving of it forth:</hi> its that great promiſe the Saints are to be looking up to the Father for in the new Teſtament Times; under the old Teſtament the Saints had a great bundle of promiſes, but there was one great and leading promiſe, that ſtood out before all the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and that was the coming of the Meſſiah, and unto this promiſe all the Types, ſhaddowes, Ceremonies and ſervices of the Law did looke, they ran into this promiſe; ſo the Saints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in the times of the new Teſtament, have a great and leading promiſe alſo, but this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49133:100"/>great promiſe of the old Teſtament is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to them, for its accompliſhed, Chriſt hath come and dyed, and is riſen againe, and we looke not for him to come and dye any more, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Fathers Juſtice; but now there is I ſay, a great and leading promiſe in the new Teſtament, which the Saints fix their eye upon above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes, and that is <hi>the promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> as the Saints under the old Teſtament, look't cheifely to this <hi>promiſe of the Meſſiah,</hi> O when will our Meſſiah come, when will the Redeemer come, when will Chriſt come; why ſo, the Saints under the new Teſtament, have <hi>this as their great expectatior,</hi> O when will the Spirit come, when will the Spirit come down more into our hearts, O when ſhall we be more fill'd with the Spirit, and be enabled to walke in the Spirit, and to live in the Spirit, and have all our teaching from the Spirit, and all our ſtrength and life and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we have from the Spirit; this is that that the Saints ſhould have their eye fixed upon under the new Teſtament; and ſo the Obſervation at this time ſhall be this.</p>
            <p>Obſer: <hi>That the promiſe of the Spirit is the great New Teſtament promiſe;</hi> it's the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that the Children of God in the times of the new Teſtament, are to be looking up to God for the fulfilling and accompliſhing of. In the proſecution of which point, I ſhall follow this Method, (all moulds and methods they are but things, wherein we are to ſeeke the edification one of another).</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you, <hi>That the promiſe of the Spirit is a great promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That its the great New Teſtament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>romiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="167" facs="tcp:49133:100"/>
            <p> Thirdly, <hi>Why the Lord held forth his Spirit to his Children as the great promiſe?</hi> why he would have them looke more upon that promiſe than upon any other promiſe</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall <hi>apply this bleſſed truth to our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The promiſe of the Spirit, <hi>it's a great promiſe,</hi> a very great promiſe: ſo it is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, If we doe conſider, <hi>The thing promiſed, the gift given by vertue of this promiſe:</hi> What can be a greater gift, than for God by promiſe to give himſelfe to a poore ſoule, for the Father and Son to give themſelves to a poore ſoule? Now the promiſe of the Spirit, it's the gift of God himſelfe, the promiſe of God himſelfe, we have God giving himſelfe by promiſe, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giving himſelfe, and the Son giving himſelfe, for theſe three are one, where the Spirit is given all are given, and where the Spirit comes and dwells, there's the dwelling of the whoſe, the Father, Son, and Spirit, all the bleſſed Trinity; now what a wonderfull gift is here? is it not a great promiſe then?</p>
            <p>Secondly, It's a great promiſe, If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>the Promiſe-Maker;</hi> wee make account of the promiſes of great men, this is a promiſe made by the greateſt in Heaven and earth, the Father and the Son are the greateſt; <hi>My ſheepe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>heare my voice, and I give unto them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, and none ſhall plucke them out of my Fathers hand, and my Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I:</hi> Here are the two greateſt in heaven, the Father and the Son, and they make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; the Spirit proceedeth from both, as the gift of either; the Father promiſeth it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49133:101"/>it's called in the Text, <hi>the promiſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the Son promiſeth it, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I goe away: for if I goe not away, the Comforter will not come unto you: but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It's a great promiſe, If we looke <hi>to the way or meanes of conveying this promiſe to the ſoule:</hi> The greater and more difficult meanes a man muſt uſe to fulfill ſome promiſe made to us, the greater and higher account we have of his promiſe; the worth of a mercy may ſometimes be meaſured by the meanes through which it is brought about: Now doe but looke at the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty's this promiſe comes thorough, It comes upon the account of Chriſts Interceſſion for it in heaven, <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall ſend you another Comforter;</hi> before this promiſe can come forth in the fulnes and glory of it, Chriſt muſt ſtrip himſelfe of his glory, come downe from heaven to earth, be made a reproach, dye a curſed death, and after this goe up to heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and there pray and plead, and all before this promiſe can be given forth; ſo that it's a promiſe that comes through all Chriſt's doings, and ſufferings, and Interceſſions, before it can be given out in the fulnes and glory of it; <hi>I will pray the Father, &amp; he ſhall give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter:</hi> It's therefore a great promiſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It's a great promiſe, If we doe but conſider, <hi>The great things that are laid up in this promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>All our ſpirituall peace and comfort is laid up in this promiſe;</hi> all that inward Joy and peace &amp; comfort that a poore ſoule hath, it's all
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49133:101"/>lodg'd up in this bleſſed promiſe; hence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is call'd <hi>the Comforter,</hi> becauſe all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort (if it be true) it comes from him; there's a Joy which men have for a ſeaſon (as that of the Stony ground) which men may have by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon working's of the Spirit, but it's not that comfort and Joy which the Spirit workes in the hearts of the Saints, in a ſpeciall way as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter; all the true Joy and comfort that Saints have, they have it in and from this promiſe; hath a ſoule comfort in <hi>a way of ſence,</hi> from the ſenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble feeling of the gifts and graces and operations of the Spirit of God in his heart? This comfort (if it be right) it comes from the Spirit, and ſo it's laid up in this promiſe; It's the Spirit of God that muſt come and worke in us, and that muſt diſcover his own workings in us, that muſt worke our grace, and make us to feele our grace, and make us to know that that which we feele, it is grace; for if the Spirit of God doe not come in and beare witneſſe to what we feele, there will be no true comfort, that we can have that way: have we comfort <hi>in a way of faith,</hi> in hanging upon the generall promiſe? A poore ſoule finds nothing, all is dry and dead, and all comfort he had formerly in duty's and ordinances is gone, now he lookes up to the promiſe, and draw's in comfort from God altogether in a way of faith when all is dead within; This comfort of faith is alſo from the Spirit, for the Spirit of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to act this faith, we are not able of our ſelves to put forth the leaſt act of faith, the ſoule cannot when he wants ſence put forth the leaſt act of faith, but it's the Spirit of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatnes of the power of the holy Spirit,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49133:102"/>that comes and raiſes up the power of a poore ſoule, the Spirit of God comes when the poore ſoule is quivering, and ſhaking, and trembling under Temptations, and comforts, ſtrengthen's, ſtay's, ſupports, refreſhes, and eſtabliſhes the heart and the ſoule; ſo all the comfort, peace, joy, and conſolation of the ſoule, it's from the Spirit, it's all lodg'd up in this promiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>All our ſpirituall light and teaching is from hence:</hi> it's the office of the holy Spirit to be the teacher of the Saints, <hi>He ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance;</hi> he is the Saints Comforter, and he is the Saints teacher, all our light and teaching, it's laid up in this promiſe; there's a vaſt difference betwixt the knowledge men have in their heads, which we call notion, and that knowledge which men have from the Spirit, which the Apoſtle pray's for, and calls <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdome and of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> if we have any true light, it's from the holy Spirit, as all outward light by which wee ſee naturall things, it's from the Sun, and if the Sun were out of the firmament there would be no light to ſee created things, ſo the inward light by which we ſee things as they are ſpirituall things, all this light is from the holy Spirit, and if the Spirit of God doe but withdraw from the heart, all it's light is but a heape of darknes; ſo, the light of the people of God it's not in themſelves, and their knowledge it's not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſometimes men may beate out know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and light by their reaſon and parts, I but there's another kinde of light in the firſt of the <hi>Cor:</hi> the 24, and this is from the holy Spirit of God; The Spirit of God it is the enlightening
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49133:102"/>principle. True reaſon it's the light of man, but its as real a truth that the Spirit of God is the light of reaſon; therefore we have a ſpeech in <hi>Job; There's a ſpirit in man, but the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of the Almighty, giving him underſtanding;</hi> that is, there's a rationall ſpirit in man, that can beate things out in a rationall way, that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and draw concluſions and Inferences, and the like, but it muſt be <hi>the Inſpiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> that muſt give him underſtanding; a man can have no true light, no true knowledge, if there be not a light enlightening this light, if there be not <hi>the Inſpiration of the Almighty</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening his underſtanding, if the ſpirit of man be not guided by the Spirit of God; the Spirit of God enlightens the naturall ſpirit and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall underſtanding of man, there's <hi>a ſpirit in man,</hi> but the <hi>Inſpiration is of the Almighty</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him underſtanding: we have as much need of the light of the Spirit to underſtand ſpirituall things, as you and I or any other have need of the light of reaſon, to teach and diſcover to us naturall things: If a man had not the light of reaſon, he were a naturall foole; and a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make out naturall things but by a naturall light: ſo, where the Spirit of God is wanting, though a man hath never ſo much reaſon, yet that man is a ſpirituall foole, and he cannot make out ſpirituall things without the light of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; and it was upon this account the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes ſo gloriouſly to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he went to preach the Goſpel to conſound the wiſdome of the wiſe, <hi>Where is the wiſe, and where is the Scribe, and the diſputer of this world?</hi> Who can underſtand the Goſpel by the brave
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49133:103"/>witts, and quicke apprehenſions of the world, and the ſharpeſt witts if they could not reach theſe things, where is their wiſdome? no ſaith the Apoſtle, this is another manner of wiſdome than the world knowes, <hi>For after that in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, the world by wiſdome knew not God, then it pleaſed God by the fooliſhnes of preaching to ſave them that beleive:</hi> The wiſe men of the world by their owne light, reaſon and parts, could never know God, God would have the knowledge of himſelfe come into his Children in another way, though they take up truth in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall way as men, (and doe not lay all upon Impreſſions and revelations) yet they receive theſe things from God, by the teaching of the bleſſed Spirit of God, and that hath demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion going along with it, <hi>I preach not in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeing words of mans wiſdome</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and the more we can learne things in the evidence &amp; demonſtration of the Spirit of God, the more light there will be in our reaſon, for the Spirit of God enlightens the ſpirit of man; if a man have a great deale of underſtanding, and be unacquainted with the way of the Spirits teaching, he knowes nothing, and underſtands nothing; <hi>The naturall man underſtands not the things of the Spirit of God, becauſe they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcern'd,</hi> diſcern'd by the light of the holy Spirit, therefore ſaith he, <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit that is of God, that we might know the things that are given to us of God;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, there are bleſſed things given us of God, glorious things given us of God, ſuch things as are worth ten thouſand
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49133:103"/>worlds given us of God, but how ſhall we know theſe things? why not by the ſpirit of the world, but by the Spirit of God, <hi>By this Spirit of God we know the things that are freely given us of God,</hi> it's the Spirit of God that enlighten's us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>All our Inward life and motion, its laid up in this promiſe:</hi> There's no motion that can be in our ſoules, which may be called ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life or ſpirituall motion, if it be not from the holy and bleſſed Spirit of God; the Spirit of God to the ſoule of man is as the ſoule is to his body; what is the ſoule to the body? the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life and motion, if the ſoule be but out of the body, the man is preſently but a carkaſe, and there's no ſtirring, moving, breathing or acting; ſo the Spirit of God is to the ſoule, if the Spirit of God be gone from the ſoule, there's no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no ſtirring, no acting, a living Saint this houre, a dead blocke the next houre, one that hath a great deale of life from God in this duty, is ſo dead and low as if he had no life at all in the next; ſo, the life of the Saints is not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but its in the Spirit of God, and ſo its laid up in this promiſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Further, <hi>All the ſpirituall ſtrength by which the ſoule moves, its all laid up and lodg'd in this great promiſe:</hi> the Spirit of God gives forth all the ſtrength the ſoule hath; <hi>Eph:</hi> 3. the latter end, <hi>We are ſtrengthened with all might by his Spirit in the inner man;</hi> all the ſtrength or might that a poore ſoule hath in the inward man, its all from the bleſſed Spirit of God; if a ſoule hath ſtrength to ſtand up againſt Satan, truly its from the Spirit of God, <hi>The Lord ſhall tread downe Satan under your feete ſhortly;</hi> If the Spirit
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49133:104"/>of God withdraw and leave the ſoule but an houre, Satan will tread him downe and trample upon him, but if the ſoule be a conqueror, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomer, its by the bleſſed Spirit, all the ſtrength we have whereby we are victors over any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, its by the bleſſed Spirit; is there the mortification, the killing of any corruption in our ſoules? its from this Spirit; <hi>If ye through the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body ye ſhall live;</hi> its not the worke of our faith, its not in our owne power, we may ſtruggle and ſtrive and labour and toile, but the leaſt corruption is too ſtrong for the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian in his owne ſtrength; but now the Spirit, that mortify's the deeds of the body; ſo, have we ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any duty, any worke, to heare, to ſpeake the word of God? truly this is not our owne, its of the bleſſed Spirit, for if the Spirit of God doe but leave a poore ſoule, it cannot ſpeake, it cannot pray, it can doe nothing; the ſtrength that acts the people of God, its not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, therefore one while they have a heart full of the groanes and breathings of the Spirit, and a mouth full of words to ſpread before God, and at another time they have not a groane in their hearts, nor a word in their mouths, and they may pump, and they can bring up nothing; this ſhews the ſtrength of Chriſtians is not from themſelves but from the holy Spirit of God, therefore a Chriſtian that can at all times command his ſtrength, to pray or preach, its to be feared that that is the ſtrength of man and not the ſtrength of God, the ſtrength of the creature and not of the Spirit, the ſtrength of parts and of old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> The Lord let's his Children feele that they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49133:104"/>have not ſtrength ſometimes, ſometimes they have, ſometimes they have not, that they might live all their whole life onely in dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; what experience had <hi>Paul</hi> of this? <hi>I know how to want, and I know how to abound, and can doe all things,</hi> but how? <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me;</hi> yet another while <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſpeake, his mouth is ſhut up, therefore <hi>pray for me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Saints, <hi>pray for me that I may have a doore of utterance;</hi> ſo, we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to thinke any thing; <hi>I am nothing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, yet by the grace of God I am that I am,</hi> all my ſtrength is laid up in the bleſſed Spirit, its not in my ſelfe, its the Spirit of God that is our ſtrength; ſo all our ſtrength is laid up in this promiſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>All our boldnes to the Throne of grace, its laid up in this promiſe:</hi> Can a poore ſoule goe to God, and cry father, father, Abba father? why truly its the Spirit that enables him ſo to doe, <hi>Becauſe you are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts crying Abba fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and that is the reaſon why a Saint one time can goe to God and ſay, father, father, he can ſpeake it out, another time he cannot goe and ſpeake out father; it is becauſe the Spirit, that makes the ſoule to cry Abba father, its not in the power of the creature, but our boldnes with the Father its the gift of the Spirit of God, its this bleſſed Spirit of Adoption whereby a man can run to God as a child unto his father.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>All our helpe and aſſiſtance at the Throne of Grace, its laid up in this promiſe: Wee know not what to pray for</hi> (Rom: 8.) <hi>as we ought, but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49133:105"/>maketh Interceſſion for us with groanes which cannot be uttered;</hi> its truth, a child of God doth not know what he ſhould pray for, what he ſhould ſpeak or utter to God, or what he ſhould moſt need, but the Spirit of God comes &amp; <hi>helpes our Infirmities;</hi> our worke in prayer is not, to thinke what we ſhould ſpeake, but to lay our ſelves downe before the Spirit, Lord come thou by thy Spirit and mannage all our worke for us, we are to ſpread our ſelves before the Spirit of God, and let the Lord come and ſpeake all in us: and the Spirit helpeth our Infirmities <hi>with groanes,</hi> not with words, the Spirit helpeth a Chriſtian many times, when the ſoule cannot bring out a word; the ſoule is full of groanings, groanings that cannot be uttered, groanings that have ſo much in them that they cannot be utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the ſoule many times is put by words, and is confounded through fulnes; for there is by the holy Spirit of God the repreſentation of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of wants together, and of a multitude of mercy's together, and the ſoule would faine breath out all to God, and he cannot ſpeak them out all, but he ſends them up all to God in a groane together, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>It helpeth our Infirmities with groanes that cannot be uttered;</hi> a poore gratious ſoule comes and ly's before God, and cannot ſpeake a word, O but it ſends up a groane to God, and though it cannot utter one word to God, yet it may ſend up twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty petitions in one groane.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Our ſpeeding at the Throne of Grace, our preſenting ſuch things there onely as are the will our father, its from this bleſſed Spirit:</hi> When we come to pray of our ſelves we doe but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49133:105"/>aske our owne Thoughts, and ſpread our owne wills before God, but if we could come and lay our ſelves alway's under the Spirit of God, and be willing alway's to be led and guided by the Spirit of God, there would come forth alway's the will of God, and not the will of the creature, <hi>He that ſearches the heart knowes what the mind of the Spirit is, becauſe he makes Interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God;</hi> let the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit pray, and it ſhall be the will of God; though we are poore creatures and doe not know the will of God, yet when the holy Spirit comes and draw's forth the heart, it ſpeakes out the will of God: O therefore let us come and lye downe under the motions of the Spirit, and the guidance of the Spirit, <hi>He that ſearcheth the heart knowes what the mind of the Spirit is,</hi> he doth not looke ſo much what words, and what brave expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how theſe things are utter'd, but <hi>he know's what the mind of his ſpirit is;</hi> when God comes and looks upon his Children, he doth not hearken what brave words come out, but what <hi>the mind of the Spirit</hi> is therein, the great thing God lookes after, is, what the Spirit groanes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>what the mind of the Spirit is:</hi> ſo that all our boldneſs at the Throne of Grace, all our helpe and aſſiſtance, and our ſpeaking ſo as to put up ſuch Petitions onely as are the will of God, its all lodg'd up in this bleſſed promiſe of the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Eightly, <hi>All our Aſſurance and Evidence from heaven, its lodg'd up in this promiſe:</hi> hath a poore ſoule any aſſurance, any hope, any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, O here its lodg'd; the Spirit is our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and evidence; <hi>He hath given us the earneſt of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49133:106"/>his Spirit;</hi> as the giving one an earneſt is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the bargaine, ſo the Spirit of God is the earneſt which aſſures the Children of God of their glorious Inheritance with the Saints in light; The Spirit is called <hi>the firſt fruites,</hi> the firſt fruites were the aſſurance of the harveſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are the beginnings of the harveſt; ſo the Spirit of God in the hearts of Gods children is <hi>the firſt fruits</hi> its the ſeale wherewith the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are ſealed, <hi>After ye beleived ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe;</hi> and <hi>grieve not the holy Spirit of God wherewith you are ſealed to the day of redemption,</hi> that comes and ſeales up heaven to them, and glory to them, the Spirit comes <hi>and witneſſes</hi> to them and with them, that they are the Children of God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit of God beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the Chidlren of God.</hi> He ſaith before <hi>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare, but ye have received the ſpirit of Adoption whereby we cry, Abba, father.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, we have not the old Covenant ſpirit, the old Teſtament ſpirit, the <hi>ſpirit of bondage to feare,</hi> but the glorious new Covenant ſpirit which helpes us to goe to God and call him father; what can be a more glorious witneſſe and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to a Chriſtian than this, yet this ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone cannot beare witnes; therefore he ſaith in the next verſe, <hi>The Spirit it ſelfe beareth witnes with our ſpirit,</hi> that is, with this glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-new-Teſtament ſpirit, the Spirit of God himſelfe comes and witneſſeth with this Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit, with this ſpirit of Adoption, that we are the Children of God; this ſweete Goſpel-ſpirit that is wrought in us, it would not witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49133:106"/>but the Spirit of God comes and puts his ſeale upon it and ſaith, O this is a true worke of mine, a true worke of the father in a child, ſo it beares witnes with our ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>The being and the Habit of Grace, its laid up in this promiſe:</hi> the Spirit of God its the roote and principle of all grace in the Saints, thoſe habits of grace within, are but the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the Spirit in the ſoule: Grace, its not a thing naturall, a thing that we bring into the world with us, but a thing created and begotten; now the creating and begetting principle, its the holy Spirit; the Spirit it is, that doth create and beget all grace, were not the Spirit firſt given, there would be no habits of grace in any; all grace in the hearts of the Saints, its from this bleſſed Spirit; and therefore its laid up in this glorious promiſe.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>All the Acting of every grace, its laid up in this promiſe alſo, the acting of faith and patience and humiliation, and all grace;</hi> as we have not the principle or habit of grace from our ſelves but from the bleſſed Spirit, ſo every act of grace, its from the holy Spirit alſo; as the Lord ſaith of his Vineyard, <hi>I will keepe it and water it every moment;</hi> God keepes his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and waters it too, and he waters it every moment, or elſe it would wither and decay; ſo the Lord keepes us and our grace, and waters us every moment, elſe we ſhould decay, the Spirit of God it is, that comes and waters us, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all our grace; though the ſoyle be never ſo good, the fruite is not brought forth if there be not dropping from heaven upon it, ſo let the ſoule be good, and the plant of grace in the ſoule,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49133:107"/>yet, if the Spirit doe not come and continually drop upon and water our hearts, there will be no fruite brought forth; every ſoule therefore that is able to put forth any grace, he hath this from the bleſſed Spirit; O what a wretched thing therefore is it, that there ſhould be ſuch a thing in the world as the ſlighting of this bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? that any man in the world ſhould ſlight and contemne this bleſſed Spirit, wherein all our grace is, and the acting of every grace lyes in it; and its the exceeding greatnes of the power of the Spirit that makes every grace to act, looke upon faith in the firſt acting, its not wrought by us, but by an exceeding great power, even the ſame that raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, when he lay under all our ſinnes and his Fathers wrath, its that power that workes the firſt acts of faith, that exceeding greatnes of power, that helps us to beleive; and ſo it is in all other grace, and the people of God doe know that their ſtrength is not in themſelves, nor their growth in themſelves, I cannot be holy, I cannot walke humbly by any ſtrength of my owne, I cannot beleive, I cannot love the Saints, nor love God, or the cauſe of God by any ſtrength of my own, I cannot doe it of my ſelfe, all the acting of my grace its from the bleſſed Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, <hi>All thoſe convictions that are wrought in the ſoule, they are from the Spirit of God:</hi> all the conviction in the ſoule, whether of ſin or of righteouſnes, it is from the Spirit of God; If a poore ſoule come to be convinc't of ſin, that he is an unbeleiver, its the Spirit of God muſt convince the world of ſin, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive not in Chriſt; if a ſoule come to ſee all his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49133:107"/>righteouſneſs nothing, whether it lye in the workes of the Law, or in the very acts of belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that all is nothing, its the Spirit muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the ſoule of righteouſnes; men run from one peice of righteouſnes to another, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin to vowes and promiſes, and thence to Reformation, and ſo to higher things, but this doth not convince till the Spirit of God come and convinces the ſoule, and then it ſaith, Lord I am nothing, I have nothing, I can doe nothing, I am empty, O that thou wouldeſt come and fill me with thy holines; all that can be done by man, and the utmoſt of reaſon and parts, and the utmoſt demonſtration of truth to the eare, can never doe this till the Spirit of the Lord come.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, <hi>All thoſe hints of truth, thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of truth, thoſe bringings of the bleſſed word and promiſe of Chriſt to our mind they are all laid up in this promiſe of the Spirit:</hi> Its the Spirit, <hi>its the Spirit that ſhall bring to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>whatſoever I have ſaid unto you;</hi> The holy Spirit of God comes and makes the ſoule to remember all the words of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, all the promiſes in the bleſſed book of God, that concernes our ſanctification, any peice of it, any thing belonging to it, or that concernes our conſolation, or any peice of it, or any thing belonging to it, they are all lodg'd up in this great and glorious and bleſſed promiſe of the Spirit of God; as in the promiſe of the Meſſiah, are lodg'd all the promiſes of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and every peice of it, ſo in this promiſe of the Spirit, is lodg'd up all the promiſes of our ſanctification &amp; conſolation; Juſtification flow's
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49133:108"/>out of the one, and holines, peace, and comfort out of the other: is it not then a great promiſe? O its a glorious and moſt bleſſed promiſe.</p>
            <p>I had thought to have ſhewne you <hi>how it is the great New-Teſtament promiſe,</hi> the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that we are to looke for under the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; but I ſhall not be able to come to that at this Time.</p>
            <p>The Lord therefore ſet that upon our hearts; and as there is much lodg'd up in this promiſe, ſo, O that our hearts were now all taken with it, that we might all looke up unto God for the giving out of this Spirit; methinkes none ſhould goe home now and ſay, I will not regard this Spirit, I doe not ſee any thing in this Spirit, much leſſe that any ſhould goe away and jeere at the Spirit, laugh at the Spirit, and make a mocke of it, O far be it from our ſoules that any here ſhould doe ſo; but let us every one looke after this Spirit, Lord come and give out of thy Spirit to my ſoule, come and give out of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to my ſoule; Lord I have been a Rebell, an Enemy, a wretch, an oppoſer, but let thy Spirit come and ſubdue my Corruption, let thy Spirit come downe and bring up my heart to thee; O thy Spirit Lord to ſubdue this wretched diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper in me, that have been a mocker and jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at thy Spirit: Poore ſoule, do'ſt thou want a word of conviction, to be thoroughly convinced before the Lord? O ſay now, O Lord ſend thy Spirit to convince me, now O Lord let thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit convince my ſoule of ſin, let thy Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince my ſoule of righteouſnes, let thy Spirit come and ſhew me how I have not beleived in Chriſt, how that I have taken up other things
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49133:108"/>beſides Chriſt as my foundation, and laid other foundations beſides the foundation of God; let the Spirit of the Lord come and ſhew me how many righteouſneſſes I have ſet up inſtead of the Lords righteouſnes: If the Spirit of God ſhould come to our hearts now, not a man or woman here but would goe out and ſay, O I am a poore wretched creature, I thought I had had wiſdome when I came hither, but I goe out a foole; and I thought I had had ſtrength when I came hither, but I am weakneſs it ſelfe; and I thought I had had parts and gifts, but I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; I thought I could have beleived and acted faith upon God, but I can doe nothing, nothing of my ſelfe; if the Lord come to convince by his Spirit it will be thus indeed.</p>
            <p>There are many legall convictions, and men goe away hardened after them, and they are ten times worſe; haſt thou man or woman been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of that, and haſt gone away mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and yet can'ſt thou come againe and ſit here and ſleepe? O beg of the Lord to give out his Spirit to convince thee, and to doe all thy workes in thee and for thee; haſt thou been a long time doubting and ſeeking what way God will owne, what truth God will owne for his truth? O labour for the Spirit, cry for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the teachings of the Spirit, beg of the Lord to teach thee by his Spirit, ſpread the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe before the Lord; haſt thou not ſaid Lord, <hi>Thy Spirit ſhall teach us all things, and guide us into all truth?</hi> Here's thy promiſe Lord, Lord now let me have thy Spirit to reveale thy truth to me, and to ſhew me thy will; and when the Spirit comes and teaches us, we ſhall know prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49133:109"/>in another way than we did before, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can ſee a cleare evident diſtinction betwixt thoſe principles he fetches in from reaſon, and thoſe he hath from the Spirit of God enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reaſon.</p>
            <p>Now wouldeſt thou depart? O beg of the Lord to come and give thee h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Spirit, and then being taught by the Spirit of God, thou wilt ſtand to the truth, the reaſon why men are this to day, and another thing to morrow, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not taught by the Spirit, but their faith is laid in the wiſdome of men, and they take up things from men, and doe beleive a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a wiſe man ſpeakes it, and when a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than he comes and ſpeakes otherwiſe, then they will leave that and take up what he ſaith; now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I came not to you with the enticeing word: of mans wiſdome, but in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit, and of power; that your faith might ſtand not in the wiſdome of man, but in the power of God;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I know how apt you are to take up things in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man, and not in the light of the Spirit of God; but cry out Lord let me have nothing but in the power of God and from thy Spirit upon my heart, in the demonſtration of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; this will hold, a man will ſtand to this, he will ſay, I did not receive this truth by the light of my reaſon, but by another light, hereupon the ſoule will hold to truth. As the Saints in Queene <hi>Mary's</hi> dayes could not diſpute, but yet they would dye for the truth, they had their principles in the light of the Spirit, and in the power of the Spirit; Now how many now aday's have their faith founded in the wiſdome of men and not in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49133:109"/>the power of God? If God ſhould come and ſift men, you will never hold if you will not learne of the Spirit, but have things onely from your reaſon. How many have ſpoken gloriouſly of the truths of the preſent age, and when it comes to ſome tryall, when there comes ſuffering, and their owne Intereſt calls off to the other ſide, turne their backs upon it? that which men have had onely from their reaſon will not lead them through Temptation, if Temptation come that man will give away his truth rather than part with his Intereſt, his honour or profit, or the like; a man that hath reaſon will gather up a great deale in the notion, but if the Lord doe not teach us by his own Spirit we ſhall not hold; O beg this every heart for himſelfe, and for all the children of God at this day, that we might not know things by the Spirit of man but by the Spirit of God, for the ſpirit of man will get a great deale of knowledge and let it out againe, O that the Spirit of God (condemn'd by many in this generation) might be honoured by us; art thou a poore ſoule? haſt thou no ſtrength nor life to duty? do'ſt thou ſay, I come to pray ſometimes and would faine have my heart in heaven, and keepe my faith up, and be full of groanes, but I cannot ſpeake a word nor utter a groane, but am juſt like a blocke? O come to the Lord and ſay, Good Lord give me of thy bleſſed Spirit, I have ſat often and heard in a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary and formall way, and ſo have I pray'd, but Lord give me thy Spirit to heare, and thy Spirit to pray, and thy Spirit to doe all in my ſoule; O then you ſhould finde ſtrength and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and helpe, and ſuch helpe as the ſoule
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49133:110"/>cannot Imagine: ſo, haſt thou not boldnes, can'ſt thou not call God father? ſay, now Lord thy Spirit, let the Spirit of Adoption come into my heart, Lord fill my heart with thy Spirit, that I may cry Abba father, if thy Spirit come downe into my ſoule I ſhall cry father, it will helpe my Infirmities and tell me what to ſay; I would goe to God but I know not what to ſay, nor what to lay before God, nor what to aske, O Lord thy Spirit now to put words into my mouth, and thy Spirit to put groanes into my heart; ſo, a poore ſoule that goes about doubting, and ſaith I am undone, ſuch and ſuch are happy and bleſſed, they are the Children of God, but I ſhall periſh for ever, whoſoever goes to heaven I ſhall goe to hell; O goe to the Lord and ſay, Lord I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee thy ſeale upon this my affliction, good Lord come and give me thy Spirit, that earneſt of glory, and ſeale my Spirit for glory, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by thy Spirit with my ſpirit that I am thy childe; O let every one looke after this, every one mind this, we are here but a little while, we run through the world and little thinke of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and then at laſt we cry out, O that I had look't after God &amp; his Spirit, O that I had now the Evidence of the Spirit; I have follow'd pride, and vanitie, and wantonneſſe, and the world, and how I might be rich, O that I had now the Spirit of God, I would give ten thouſand worlds if I had them, that I had but the witneſſe of the Spirit, and the Evidence of the Spirit; O, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians doe not mind the great things of God, of Religion, and of their ſoules, but we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Religion in a forme, and as an art like a trade in the world, men thinke they do enough if they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49133:110"/>doe but now &amp; then ſay over a prayer, and read one of the Pſalmes, or the like, O you will wiſh another day, O that I had Jeſus Chriſt, O that I were ſealed with the Spirit of God, if you want this, the day of Chriſt will be a bitter day to you: ſo, is your heart dry and withering? pray to God to come by his Spirit and water you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment; it may be your hearts are a little ſtirred when you are under a Sermon, but you goe away againe and forget all, now ſay ſoule, ſay to the Lord my conſcience is touched now, good Lord as I goe out of this place water me, and as I goe home water me, and all the weeke water me, and every moment Lord water me till I come againe; there's need of this, beg of the Lord for it, and pray to the Lord to give his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for this end, for the Spirit of the Lord doth this; ſo, haſt thou had many ſweete promiſes many times, and thou forgetteſt them? cry Lord thy Spirit, thy Spirit to bring all theſe things to my remembrance, all the glorious promiſes, O that I might remember them all, and that by the holy and bleſſed Spirit; O that day is not farre off, that God will come downe with more abundance of this Spirit, it will fall upon our hearts, O therefore thinke of theſe things, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſomething, and goe away with theſe groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in your hearts, O father, give thy Spirit thy Spirit to my poore ſoule.</p>

            <p>The laſt time I ſhewed you that this promiſe was a great promiſe: I ſhall now (the Lord aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting) goe on, and come to the ſecond thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Promiſe of the Spirit is the great new Teſtament promiſe.</hi> I ſay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the holy Spirit is the great new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment promiſe: here are two things to be cleared and proved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>the promiſe of the Spirit is a new Teſtament promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>its the great new Teſtament promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That its <hi>a new Teſtament promiſe;</hi> my my meaning is not, that its a promiſe proper and peculiar unto the new Teſtament Times, ſo, as that we are to conceive the people of God that lived under the old Teſtament Adminiſtration
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49133:112"/>had not the Spirit, we muſt not ſo conceive of the thing, for the people of God in the time of the old Teſtament they had the Spirit; <hi>Holy men of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and therefore they had the holy Spirit with them; and if they had it, they had it in a way of promiſe, and therefore its not a promiſe ſo peculiar to the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment times, as that the Saints of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not this promiſe as well as we; nay the Saints and people of God under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had that very ſame Covenant (in which this glorious promiſe of the Spirit is held forth and given) that we have, the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it runs downe even from <hi>Adam</hi> (as I may ſay) to the end of all things, the new Covenant it runs through all the times of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and its this Covenant (the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) that gives forth the Spirit, and they had that Covenant running through all that long time, they had therefore the Spirit given forth to them. But when I ſay, the promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a new Teſtament promiſe, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus; <hi>That its a promiſe that doth in a more eſpeciall manner relate to the new Teſtament Times,</hi> though it was a promiſe that had a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling even in old Teſtament times, yet it hath in a more eſpeciall manner a fulfilling to the Saints in new Teſtament Times: the people of God in the times of the old Teſtament, they had the Spirit; but they had the Spirit (as I may ſo ſay) in the beginning, or in the dropping of it; but now the people of God in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Times, they have the powring of it forth, looke to the promiſe of the Spirit in new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49133:112"/>Times, and the promiſe runs to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it forth, that is, more abundance of it; the people of God in the times of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had the promiſe of the Spirit, but they had not this promiſe as their great promiſe, for (as I told you the laſt day) they had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſe which was their great promiſe, they had <hi>the promiſe of the Meſſiah as their great promiſe;</hi> but now the people of God under the new Teſtament Adminiſtration, they have <hi>the promiſe of the Spirit as their great promiſe,</hi> they have not onely the promiſe of the Spirit, but they have it as the greateſt promiſe of all other made to them under that adminiſtration. Now theſe things being premiſed, (which I thought meete to doe, that there might not be a miſtake, and that none might exclude the people of God of old from the Spirit) I ſhall ſhew you, That the promiſe of the Spirit is <hi>a new Teſtament promiſe;</hi> and this will appeare from two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>All thoſe ſeverall promiſes that we find in the old Teſtament, of the more full giving forth, and powring out of the bleſſed Spirit, did not relate to thoſe times, but to the new Teſtament Times for their fulfilling:</hi> I ſhall ſhew you this in two or three places; In <hi>Ezek:</hi> 36 27. among many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promiſes of the new Covenant this is one, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keepe my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and doe them;</hi> but to what time doth this more eſpecially relate; why, it doth relate (as you may ſee, if you looke into the foregoing verſes) unto the time when God will gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his Antients the Jewes out of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's, verſ. 24. <hi>For I will take you from among the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49133:113"/>heathen, and gather you out of all Country's, and will bring you into your owne land:</hi> it doth in a more eſpeciall manner, looke to the time of the Jewes coming in for the compleate fulfilling and accompliſhing of this promiſe; then will it moſt evidently be ſeene, that the Spirit of God is the guider and leader and teacher of his Children, then will the promiſe of the Spirit in the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it be more viſible. And ſo likewiſe in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> 2.28, 29 verſes, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that I will powre out my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, your old men ſhall dreame dreames, your young men ſhall ſee viſions: And alſo upon the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and upon the handmaids in thoſe dayes, will I powre out my Spirit:</hi> To what time doth this relate? Compare the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> and you ſhall there find, that <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, now is this word fulfilled in your eares, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 17 verſes, <hi>But this is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel, And it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes (ſaith God) I will powre out my Spirit upon all fleſh,</hi> &amp;c The fulfilling of it is under the new Teſtament Adminiſtration; and truly though that in the firſt powering out of the Spirit, there was a glorious fulfilling of it in part, yet (I take it) the compleate fulfilling of it, and that which is ſpecially aymed at in the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, not to the firſt, but to the laſt of the new Teſtament times; for <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeakes of thoſe times, <hi>when he ſhall bring againe the Captivity of Jacob and Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeakes of a more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall powring out of the Spirit upon Gods ſons and daughters, than was before; ſo, as that at the beginning of the new Teſtament times,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49133:113"/>there was a fulfilling of that promiſe in part, yet it hath in a more ſpeciall manner a looke to the laſt times, in which the people of God upon the account of this new Teſtament promiſe, may waite for the promiſe of the Father, and expect more of the bleſſed Spirit to be given forth to them, to be powred out upon them. So likewiſe <hi>Zach:</hi> 12.10. <hi>And I will powre upon the houſe of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of grace and of ſupplications, and they ſhall looke upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourne,</hi> &amp;c. But when is this? why, it is (if you looke into the 14 Chapter) in a time when all nations ſhall be gathered againſt <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and when God will deſtroy all nations that ſhall come againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in that day when there ſhall be great mourning among the Jewes upon their coming in, in that day this bleſſed promiſe will have a glorious fulfilling: all thoſe pretious promiſes of the powring forth of the Spirit that we read of in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they looke to the new Teſtament times.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this is a new Teſtament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth appeare, <hi>from the words of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> If you look into <hi>John</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living water. But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that beleive on him, ſhould receive: for the holy Ghoſt was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the giving forth of the Spirit is made a conſequent of Chriſts glorification, of Chriſts being glorified at the right hand of the Father; and therefore the more full giving forth of the Spirit, its a promiſe to the new Teſtament times. But then</p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:49133:114"/>
            <p> Secondly, How doth it appeare that this is the great new Teſtament promiſe? the promiſe of the Spirit is a new Teſtament promiſe, Gods people in new Teſtament times, they looke for it; but how doth it appeare this is the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to be of all other promiſes the greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this diſpenſation?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, There are three great promiſes that we have in the booke of God, three promiſes that may be called the greateſt of all; firſt, there's the promiſe of Chriſts firſt coming; Secondly, There's the promiſe of the coming of the Spirit; and then Thirdly, There's the promiſe of Chriſts ſecond coming; Theſe are (as I may ſay) the greateſt promiſes that we have in all the booke of God: The promiſe of Chriſts firſt coming, that was a promiſe that did belong to the old Teſtament Adminiſtration, as I ſhewed you the laſt day: The glorious promiſe of Chriſts ſecond coming, that is to have its fulfilling and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, in the time of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the people of God doe hope and waite for; which coming of Chriſts perſonall appearance, his ſecond coming in glory, under that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ſhall have its fulfilling: But now the promiſe of the coming of the Spirit, that is the promiſe that we are to expect the fulfilling of, under the preſent Adminiſtration, that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration which is betwixt Chriſts firſt and ſecond coming; not but that there ſhall be much more (as I ſhall ſhew anon) of the Spirit of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be perſonally preſent with his Children, yet notwithſtanding the great promiſe of the Spirit (which is ſpoken ſo much of, in the old Teſtament and in the new)
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49133:114"/>is that, which we are to looke up to God for, betwixt the time of Chriſts firſt and ſecond coming. When Jeſus Chriſt was to goe up to heaven and leave his Children, and they were to undergoe a very blacke and tempeſtuous day, and Chriſt ſaw what the rage of the world was, what the Roman power, and the Antichriſtian power, and the Kings of the earth would doe, therefore that he might not in ſuch a darke day leave them comfortleſſe, he makes this great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit; as if he ſhould have ſaid, In all that time, O Saints, when ever you ſuffer, looke for my Spirit; when ever you want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, looke for my Spirit; when you feare that this Antichriſt will deceive you, looke for my Spirit; and ſo this promiſe of the Spirit, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that runs through all that time in a more eſpeciall manner to the people of God, which they doe wait for the fulfilling of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object:</hi> If the promiſe of the Spirit be the great new Teſtament promiſe, how then comes it to paſſe that the Saints and people of God under the new Teſtament Adminiſtration, have ſo little of the Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> Why truly there may be ſomething in this as one reaſon of it, namely, <hi>The way of Gods diſpenſation; which hath been, and it is, to put death's upon his promiſes, not onely before the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling time of a promiſe comes, but even when the fulfilling time is come, and in the fulfilling time God will put a death upon his promiſe.</hi> Though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had a bleſſed promiſe made to him by God, that he ſhould have ſeede, and God told him that it ſhould be in Bondage foure hundred and thirty yeares, and at the end of that time he
<pb facs="tcp:49133:115"/>would wonderfully ſhew his power, bringing them forth with a high hand, and give them the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but before the fulfilling time came, there's firſt one death and another upon the promiſe; firſt <hi>Abraham</hi> was a hundred yeares old, his body dead, and yet without any that ſhould be the heire of the promiſe; and <hi>Sarah</hi> is old and her wombe dead before the fulfilling of the promiſe; and after the heire of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was come forth, <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt goe and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up his Son, why, what might <hi>Abraham</hi> thinke would become of Gods promiſe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the Son of the promiſe, and muſt I goe and offer him up, where will Gods promiſe be? Here was a death upon a death upon it; and after this, <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Son of the promiſe, in whoſe loines (as I may ſay) the promiſe ran, the promiſed ſeede was to come forth from him, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> (after <hi>Abraham</hi>) had no ſeede a great while; ſo that before the fulfilling time of the promiſe came, there was deaths upon deaths upon it: yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the Time was come for the fulfilling it, when the Lord was now giving forth that that he had promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and when he had ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out, yet then the Lord in the very fulfilling time brings deaths upon it; when the Lord had raiſed up ſome meaſure of faith in the people of God, expecting deliverance, yet the bondage grow's ſo great that their hearts grow dead as to hope, and they thinke they are further off than ever before; and afterward, when they thought they had nothing to doe but to run to the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aan,</hi> no, but there are great deaths in the way, they muſt goe through a Sea, and through a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:49133:115"/>and this not all, but they muſt wander forty yeares in the wilderneſſe, and there the whole generation that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> dyes, what deaths were there upon the promiſe in the fulfilling time? So God made a promiſe to his people in <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> time, that after 70 yeares Captivitie in <hi>Babylon</hi> they ſhould come to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> againe, and that ſhould be built; but when the fulfilling time was come, what deaths were put upon the promiſe, ſo that for many yeares together the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was hindred? I doe urge this notion to this purpoſe, that though the new Teſtament Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, be the Adminiſtration in which the Saints are to waite for the fulfilling of this great promiſe, yet in the fulfilling time <hi>there may be very great deaths upon the promiſe,</hi> and ſuch, as we may ſee very little of the Spirit given forth, and it may be for ages and generations together (as in ſome generations it hath been) but little of the Spirit may appeare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe although the promiſe of the Spirit is the great new Teſtament promiſe that is made to thoſe times, yet the fulfilling of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may not be alike to all, but may be eſpecially made good to ſome periods of that time;</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt was the great old Teſtament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that which Saints all along in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament waited for, but that was not fulfilled till the laſt period of that time: ſo it may be with this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another Reaſon why Saints under the new Teſtament Adminiſtration have ſo little of the Spirit, though this is the great new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment promiſe, It may be <hi>from Saints darknes in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49133:116"/>the way of the new Teſtament (Saints going out of the way of the new Teſtament) and that Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that is in and upon the ſpirits of the Saints;</hi> As the promiſe of the Spirit is the great promiſe of the new Teſtament that God gives fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th in new Teſtament times, ſo God will give forth his promiſe in the way of the new Teſtament; if ſo be therefore the saints be darke as to the way of the new Teſtament, in which God will give forth new Teſtament mercy's, why truly they may be under the new Teſtament Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet have but very little of the Spirit; for even in new Teſtament times there is (as I may ſay) an old Teſtament ſpirit upon the Saints, they looke upon themſelves (through their darkneſs and Ignorance) as ſtanding under the old Adminiſtration, they have thereby the Spirit of the old Covenant and of the old Teſtament wrought in them; and ſo far as they have an old Teſtament ſpirit, ſo far there will not be a giving forth of the Spirit to them in that full meaſure, for God will give forth the Spirit in the way of the new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt:</hi> What is the way of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which God will give out new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Mercy's?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ:</hi> To that I anſwer, <hi>The way of the new Teſtament its this, To receive all from God as I am a poore wretched nothing creature:</hi> This indeed is the very way of the new Teſtament, in which God doth give forth new Teſtament mercy's to his Children; if a ſoule come to Chriſt for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the way of the new Teſtament is, to give forth this pretious glorious priviledge to him as he is a poore wretched ſinner, an unworthy one;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49133:116"/>and ſo if we come to the Lord for the Spirit in the way of the new Teſtament, why it is to come to God as I am a poore miſerable ſinner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, having no hope nor any thing in my ſelfe, that I can ground hope upon, why God ſhould give forth the Spirit to me; This is the way of the new Teſtament to come to God for all, and to expect all from God as I am a poore ſinner; why now if Saints be unacquainted with the way of the new Teſtament, they may miſſe of the mercy's of the new Teſtament: if Saints come to God for the Spirit and bring ſomewhat of their owne with them, (as if a man in coming to God for Juſtification, will bring a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his owne to patch with the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, the Lord will not give it forth, if you doe not come as a poore ſinner that hath nothing in himſelfe, expecting all from the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt, ſo, if I come to God for the Spirit,) if I thinke to bring ſomewhat of my owne, to bring ſome good deſires, and ſome good breathings with me, and thou ſaiſt, Lord I am ſo and ſo, I have ſuch and ſuch breathings, therefore give me the Spirit; why, thou art now out of the way of the new Teſtament, and God will not give forth the Spirit: if you would have the Spirit you muſt ſay, Lord thou knoweſt I have nothing, thou knoweſt that there is not a good thought, nor a good deſire in me, and I bring nothing with me, but am a poore wretched ſinner, and know not what to doe but I lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before thee, that thou wouldeſt give forth thy Spirit to me; ſo that Saints, they may in new Teſtament times enjoy but very little of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if they are caſt into the way of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:49133:117"/>
            <p> Fourthly, Another ground and Reaſon of this point, why there is ſo little of the Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth, and this the great new Teſtament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is, <hi>becauſe Saints are no more in aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together;</hi> Saints are not found (as I may ſay) as they ſhould be in the worke of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together; there was a twofold giving forth of the Spirit to the Diſciples and Apoſtles of our Lord; Chriſt did give them the Spirit, and that Immediatly at his reſurrection, he gave them the Spirit, and breathed the holy Ghoſt upon them in ſome meaſure, to beare up their ſpirits againſt the ſorrows that were to attend them; afterward he gave them the Spirit more fully; and at both theſe times, the Spirit was given forth unto them when they were aſſembled together; <hi>John</hi> 20.22. <hi>When the Diſciples were aſſembled together Chriſt came and breathed on them, ſaying, Receive ye the holy Ghoſt:</hi> ſo if you looke into the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> where you have the more full giving forth of the Spirit, you ſhall finde it was <hi>when the Saints were aſſembled together.</hi> Acts 2. the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chapter: Here's the giving forth of the Spirit in a more full meaſure to them, and it was <hi>when they were all with one accord in one place,</hi> when they were met together: Chriſt might have given it to them one by one, when they were alone, no, but our deare Lord chooſeth to give forth the Spirit when they were aſſembled together; that teaches us how much he loves the aſſembly's of the Saints, the Saints meetings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; that though he could have given them the Spirit to every one in a corner alone, yet he will not doe it, but he chooſes to give it to them when they are aſſembled together: ſo that if the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49133:117"/>Saints neglect their meeting together, there may be little enjoyment of the Spirit, though it be the great promiſe of the new Teſtament Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. So much for the ſecond thing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Why is the promiſe of the Spirit, the great promiſe under the new Teſtament;</hi> why doth God give this as their great promiſe?</p>
            <p>Firſt, One Reaſon of it may be this, <hi>Becauſe God in the new Teſtament Adminiſtration would make an advance, a ſtep neerer</hi> (as I may ſay) <hi>to heavenly perfection and glory, than the former adminiſtration was:</hi> God all along hath been making an advance, ever ſince man fell God hath been making an advance, carrying him up ſtep by ſtep; now the more of the Spirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth, or the more of the Spirit is in any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, the greater the advance is, for its the Spirit that makes the advance in the hearts of Gods Children; now becauſe the Lord under the new Teſtament Adminiſtration would make an advance, he would raiſe the hearts of his Saints nearer to heaven and glory than they were before, therefore he gives forth more of the Spirit, and he doth hold forth the promiſe of the Spirit as the great promiſe; and indeed, in the Adminiſtration that is to come (upon this account, in that of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) there ſhall not be leſſe, but there ſhall be more of the Spirit, for if there ſhould be leſſe there could not be an advance, there ſhall be the perſonall preſence of Chriſt, and more of his Spirit too; if we did looke upon it onely as an outward thing, then it might well be called (as ſome call it) a carnall thing, but there ſhall be more of the Spirit of God given forth, in that day there ſhall be an
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49133:118"/>advance in the Saints upon this account.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord gives forth the Spirit as the great new Teſtament promiſe, <hi>Becauſe new Teſtament Saints they are Sons:</hi> This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives, <hi>Gal:</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe yee are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit into your hearts, crying Abba father:</hi> the father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from a Son (a growne Son) that he ſhould carry himſelfe better than a child; he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from his Son that he ſhould know how to governe himſelfe, and to order things better than a ſervant; why now new Teſtament Saints <hi>are Sons,</hi> and the Lord doth expect under the new Teſtament, that there ſhould be a better carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that there ſhould be more holines, that they ſhould know how to governe themſelves in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of way than the people of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Teſtament: Now to the end that Saints might be able to governe themſelves in another manner of way, its needfull they ſhould have more wiſdome and grace given forth to them, and that they may have it, God gives forth more of the Spirit: <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons therefore he hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son therefore he hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe God doth expect more worke from new Teſtament Saints:</hi> This follow's upon the other, as yee are <hi>Sons</hi> there is more worke expected, God lookes for more duty and more obedience from the Saints of the new Teſtament, than he did expect from the Saints of the old Teſtament; in the new Teſtament they have not ſo much tireing worke, they have not ſo much burdenſome worke, O but if you looke to the ſpirituall worke, as they come to higher light,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49133:118"/>ſo God lookes for higher obedience, therefore for <hi>Moſes</hi> his ten precepts in the old Teſtament we have many ſpirituall precepts in the new: the new Teſtament doth not ſet us free from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and obedience, but indeed the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment calls us to a more ſtrick't holines and a more ſpirituall obedience, ye are called to a higher pitch of holines and obedience under the new Teſtament, and not freed from it; the Lord hath ſet his Saints free from all that that was burdenſome and that that was legall obedience under the old Covenant, but they are not free from obedience, indeed the Saints of the new Teſtament they are called to a higher pitch of obedience; as one that is a ſon growne, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not lay ſuch laws upon him as he doth upon a little Child, you muſt not meddle with this, nor doe that, nor goe out of the doores, nor run in the wet and dirty your ſelfe, &amp;c. there are a great many lawes laid upon a child, but now when once the ſon is growne, the father lay's no ſuch law's upon him, but he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that this growne ſon ſhould doe him more ſervice than the child, there's not the law's upon him as was upon the child, the ſon is free, but yet notwithſtanding here's more worke call'd for at the hands of the ſon: ſo it was with the people of God under the old Teſtament, the Apoſtle tells us, they were <hi>heires under age,</hi> and therefore their ſtate was <hi>nothing differing from the ſtate of a ſervant:</hi> though they were Lord's of all in the appointment of the father, and were true heires, yet becauſe they were under age, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a rigid Governour and Tutor as the old Covenant, that held them under the rod of a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49133:119"/>great many law's; but now under the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament we are ſons, and being ſons, the people of God they ſhould goe out &amp; ſerve God free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with another manner of ſpirit: I doe not ſay we doe ſo, for truly we are much to ſhort of what we ſhould be, the Saints ſhould goe out and worſhip God with a free ſpirit; we are not ſet looſe from duty's, but we are rather called to do more, &amp; that in another manner, in a free man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a free ſpirit; as one that is an appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he lives in a ſervile feare of his Maſter, and doth a great deale of worke, why now when this man comes to have his freedome doth he doe leſſe? no, he doth more worke, but he doth it with a free ſpirit, he doth it with another ſpirit; ſo its with the Saints under the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, they doe more worke under the new Teſtament, but with leſſe feare than under the old Teſtament, being delivered out of the hands of their enemies, they ſerve him without feare in holines and righteouſnes all their day's.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another ground and Reaſon of it may be this, <hi>God hath greater diſcovery's of truth for the new Teſtament times, and his people under the new Teſtament Adminiſtration, than was for the times of the old Teſtament under that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and therefore the Lord holds forth the promiſe of the Spirit as the great promiſe:</hi> under the old Teſtament the Lord brought forth truth by little and little, precept upon precept, and line upon line, and here a little and there a little; God brought forth truth after divers and ſundry manners, ſometimes by way of viſion &amp; dreames, and voice, and the like, many way's of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But now under the new Teſtament God
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49133:119"/>ſpeakes out all his word, he hath ſpoken in theſe laſt times by his Son, he ſpeakes forth all his mind to us at once; now the more truth is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, the more need we have of the Spirit to enable us to underſtand this Truth, for its by the Spirit we are given to underſtand the truth's of God, as they are held forth in their beauty glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and fulnes: and therefore becauſe Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Teſtament Adminiſtration was to ſpeake out all of truth, the whole of truth; that the Saints and people of God, might be able to apprehend the bleſſed truths of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as they are held forth to them, therefore it is neceſſary that they ſhould have more of the holy Spirit given forth to them under the new Teſtament Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Becauſe the Saints under the new Teſtament are to conflict with greater Tryalls and more ſore Temptations than Saints of the old, and therefore the Lord gives forth mere of the Spirit;</hi> Though the people of God under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment met with ſore Tryalls, yet they were not comparable to the ſufferings of the Saints under the new Teſtament, the rage of the Heathen and Antichriſtian powers was greater than ever the world knew before; now to beare up the people of God under this ſad-black-long day that they were to goe through in ſuffering, they had need of the Spirit; therefore God gives forth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he doth promiſe that, as the great new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If it be ſo, That the promiſe of the Spirit is the great new Teſtament promiſe, <hi>Then hence we ſee what that thing is that all of us ſhould have our eyes and our hearts and our thoughts fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49133:120"/>upon, and taken up with;</hi> O that every ſoule would be looking for it, crying for it, Lord give me thy Spirit, what ever the ſoule wants, it may goe to God and ſay, Lord give me thy Spirit: This is the great promiſe, in which all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are lockt up, the promiſe of conviction, the promiſe of ſtrength and life, all are rapt up in this; why, now we ſhould goe to God in a more ſpeciall manner for the performance of this promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. <hi>O then what ſpiritualnes is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Saints of the new Teſtament?</hi> If in the old Teſtament Time, when the promiſe of the Spirit was not given forth as the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, if then ſpiritualnes was required, O how much more is it required of the Saints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God under the new Teſtament? if under the Adminiſtration of the letter there was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſpiritualnes, then how much more is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired under that Adminiſtration, which is the Adminiſtration of the Spirit? if the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the letter be ſpirituall, and ſaith to all the Children of God live ſpiritually under me,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Saints, now you are under the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit, <hi>It doth beſpeake us to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, to have ſpirituall hearts, to be ſpirituall in all our duty's, in all our addreſſes to God.</hi> Truly its not ſo much the length of our duty's, the multitude of our duty's that God lookes at, but that that God lookes at is the ſpiritualnes of the duty; what ſhall I find of my ſpirit in that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? what ſhall I find of my ſpirit in that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? what ſhall I find of my ſpirit in that word ſpoken? what ſhall I find of my ſpirit in that ſoule? God lookes at the ſpiritualnes of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49133:120"/>and performance: men may pray houres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and twenty times a day, and yet not all this ſo acceptable to God as a poore broken expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and groane of another poore ſoule may be; and truly, you ſhall find God will not Judge as they doe, if there be much of the Spirit, if it be in poore broken expreſſions, its more acceptable unto God than a multitude of words, and there be not much of the Spirit; Conſcience will not let men alone, but they muſt pray, but doe you looke if you have the Spirit in a duty, for this God lookes at: there are many, that like to the rich men that caſt into the treaſury, they are able to offer up abundance, as to the bulke, the outward part, the outſide of a duty, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of their parts and gifts, O but many a poore gratious ſoule, that hath not thoſe parts and gifts and abilities, and cannot ſpeake twenty words together ſo handſomely as ſome (it may be) can ſpeake houres together, yet this mans prayer may be more pretious in the account of God than all that the other doth; many a ſoule can caſt in much, yet its little with God, and many a ſoule caſt's in little as to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yet its much with God; as all the gifts of the rich men were little with Chriſt, yet the two mites of the widdow it was much with him: O that we might not looke ſo much unto the outward building, as to what there is of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. How ſpirituall was that holy man <hi>Paul</hi> in prayer, what ſpirituall Petitions, what ſpirituall groanes did he offer up? he could never know when he had enough, he muſt have all, he muſt be filled with all the fulnes of God, he muſt comprehend with all Saints, what is the height
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49133:121"/>and depth and length and breadth, and muſt know the love of God which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; all his prayers run in ſuch a high way, as one that never could know when he had enough, then we are acceptable when all that we doe is fill'd with the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As its good to have our prayers ſo fill'd with the breath of the Spirit, <hi>ſo in our diſcourſes we ſhould be more ſpirituall:</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of good people they are too empty, there's too little of the Spirit in them; there are young Chriſtians (many men and women) can tell, when the Lord firſt wrought upon their hearts, they could not endure to come into that company that would not diſcourſe of that which was good, and they cared not to heare of any thing but God and Chriſt and heavenly things, but now they have been a great while in the Schoole of Chriſt, they can goe a great while together and have no conference of ſpirituall and heavenly things; <hi>I remember thy kindneſs</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> youthfull times were loving times, then their hearts were warmed, and then they were full of good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and diſcourſes, but now Saints can go up &amp; down &amp; meet one another, and ſpeak of nothing but about their trade, &amp;c. We are leſſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in our diſcourſes, whereas we ſhould be more: The two Diſciples were in good diſcourſe, and as they were ſo Imployed Chriſt came to them by the way and made their hearts to burne within them; ſo it is with Saints now, when Chriſt comes and meetes his Children in ſpirituall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he warmes their hearts in a ſpirituall way: yea Chriſt himſelfe left us a patterne of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49133:121"/>this, for it is ſaid of him, that after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he continued forty dayes ſpeaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdome of God, the verſe before the Text: This was the diſcourſe of Chriſt about the things of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, about things appertaining to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and if we were riſen with Chriſt, we ſhould delight to ſpeake of the things of the kingdome of God, but its too little in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>We ſhould be more ſpirituall in all our Meditations:</hi> It is reported of that holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of Chriſt Mr <hi>John Bradford,</hi> that he was ſo ſpirituall and heavenly in his Meditations, that ordinarily as he was at meate, the Teares would Trickle off his cheekes upon the Table; ſo, if we would be ſpirituall in our thoughts and duty's, we muſt be ſpirituall in our Meditations, a man that hath not ſpirituall Meditations, will not be ſpirituall in any thing elſe, for Meditation it feeds the ſoule with ſtrength and life, and the more ſpirituall a ſoule is in Meditation, the more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall will it be in other things.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>We ſhould be more ſpirituall in all our Converſation:</hi> How ſpirituall was <hi>Pauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? <hi>Our Converſation is in heaven;</hi> how few are there of us whoſe converſations are like his? Take moſt men in the world, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in hell or the world, one of the two, either they are prophane, and ſo their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in hell, or they are onely Civill, or if more yet they are Covetous, worldly, carnall, &amp;c. and ſo their converſation is in the world; few there are that have heaven written upon their converſation, heaven written upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their thoughts, words, and actions, &amp;c.</p>

                  </gap>uing the bleſſed Spirit of God:</hi> If it be the great promiſe of the Goſpel, its a great ſin to under-value him; as in the old Teſtament, thoſe that would not believe the great promiſe of the Meſſiah, were to be accurſed, as Pagans and Heathens; ſo in the new Teſtament, he that ſhall ſpeake ſlightly of this great and glorious Promiſe of the Spirit, is not a Chriſtian, but a Pagan, a Heathen; if he can ſpeake ſlightly of the great promiſe of the new Teſtament, he doth under-value it: take heed of under-valuing this great promiſe of the Spirit; men doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the Spirit divers way's.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>When indeed they have but a low Eſteeme of the Spirit of God;</hi> When a man hath a low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of a thing that is of great worth, then he under-values that thing, ſo when a man hath a low eſteeme of the Spirit of God, he under-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Men under-value the Spirit of God <hi>when they doe not cry unto God for his Spirit:</hi> when a thing of wonderfull worth and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may be had for asking for, and men will not aske for it, its an under-valuing of it, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>My father will give the holy Spirit to them that aske him,</hi> Luk. 11.13. <hi>If your earthly fathers know how to give good things to their children that aske them, how much more ſhall your heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give his Spirit to them that aske him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Men under-value the Spirit, when they would ſet-up any thing equall with or above the Spirit:</hi> when then cry up learning, parts, gifts, or any other thing more than the Spirit,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49133:122"/>this is an undervaluing of the Spirit; though theſe things be good in their place, and the beſt parts of pure nature, yet they are not the Spirit, and if we goe to ſet up any of theſe things with the Spirit, we doe exceedingly under-value the Spirit of God: The reaſon why the Lord is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting contempt upon learning and parts in our day's, its becauſe men ſet them up equall with the Spirit, looking upon theſe things as fitting them for the worke of God, and not looking for the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Men under-value the holy Spirit of God, when they diſpiſe the little ones of Chriſt in whem the Spirit of the Father dwells:</hi> When I love one Saint that hath the Spirit becauſe of his greatnes, (he goes in ſilke and ſattin, and is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and therefore I love him) and diſpiſe another Saint that hath the Spirit becauſe of his meanneſſe, he goes in his leather-coate &amp; there's little love to ſuch a one; now when Saints diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe meane ones in whom the Spirit of the father dwells, there's an under-valuing of the Spirit; <hi>If any diſpiſe one of theſe little ones, it were better for a milſtone to be hanged about his necke, and that he were caſt into the midſt of the Sea;</hi> why? becauſe there's a diſpiſing of the Spirit of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that dwells in them; every poore little and contemptible one of Chriſt's, though never ſo poore in the world, we muſt love them; for if I deſire to prize a Saint becauſe of the Spirit in him, then I ſhall prize the meaneſt Saint as well as the greateſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Men under-value the Spirit when they ſtop their eares againſt the Motions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of it:</hi> if a man inſtruct me, adviſe me,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49133:123"/>or counſell me for my good, I will not hearken to him, but ſlight what he ſaith, I undervalue the man in undervaluing his Counſell; ſo, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the ſpirit when we ſlight and will not hearken to the motions and dictates of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Men undervalue the Spirit when they ſpeak ſlightly and contemptuouſly of it;</hi> when they jeare at the people of God, ſaying, You have the Spirit forſooth, aye, ſuch a one prayes, ſpeaks by the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men know not what they ſay when they ſpeak thus, ſuch ſlight words of the Spirit, argues an undervaluing thereof: If you did know the worth of the Spirit, you would not ſpeak thus.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Men undervalue the Spirit, when in a a down-right way they perſecute the Spirit;</hi> when they hate a Saint, and perſecute a Saint for no other reaſon in the world that they can give, but becauſe he is a Saint, and hath the Spirit in him.

            <p>
               <hi>Last <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is the Promiſe of the Spirit the great Goſpel Promiſe? <hi>Then hence let us learne the duty in the Text, to waite upon God for the Spirit.</hi> Promiſes are to be waited for; this is the great Goſpel Promiſe; this Promiſe of the Spirit here, is not ſo much the Promiſe of the having of the Spirit, (for that many old Teſtament Saints had, and the Diſciples had before this time that Chriſt bids them waite for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) as the having more of it. When ever you come to an Ordinance, when you come to the Aſſemblies of the Saints, ſay, O Lord now give downe thy Spirit, why may not thy Spirit be given downe to me now? Thou did'ſt give
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49133:123"/>downe thy Spirit formerly when the Saints were met together? So, waite in every duty for the Spirit to come downe, be alwayes waiting for this Promiſe of the Spirit, it's an every-day Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for though it be fullfilled in part, yet there is more and more of it ſtill to be given forth, and will be every day till we come to heaven; ſo as that there is no time in which we can ſay, this Promiſe is ſo fullfilled to us, as that we need no more to waite for the fullfilling of it.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Promiſes have the time of their fullfilling, and then the duty of waiting cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; but this Promiſe is every day fullfilling, and this Promiſe will never be ſo fulfilled, while we abide in this houſe of clay, till we come to Heaven, but there will be room left for waiting. Which conſidered, will anſwer that Objection which kills our hearts in waiting: O, I have waited ſo long, and yet have not the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Poore ſoule, It may be thou haſt not that meaſure of the Spirit thou lookeſt at; thou wouldeſt have ſo much of the Spirit as to have no room left for waiting for any more; but this Promiſe of the Spirit is not ſuch a Promiſe, it is a Promiſe as is fullfilled by degrees, and will not be compleatly fullfilled till thou comeſt to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thou mayeſt therefore have more of the Spirit than thou had'ſt before, and thy deſires after it, and complaints more then formerly for the want of it, argue thou haſt it; but thou haſt not ſo much of it as thou would'ſt have, and therefore thou complaineſt: O ſoule, bleſſe God for what thou haſt, and waite for more, and in Gods time the Promiſe of the Father ſhall be fullfilled to thee according to thy deſire. We
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49133:124"/>ſhould be every day begging for the Spirit, Lord give me more of thy Spirit: Waite upon God for the Spirit, that we may have more of the Spirit of God, that we may be taught more by the Spirit, inſtructed more by the Spirit, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured more by the Spirit, led more by the Spirit, and ſealed more by the Spirit; and the Lord grant our ſoules may be filled with this Spirit, and that Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit may dwell in us, and take poſſeſſion of us, from henceforth even for ever.</p>

            <p>And we ſhould doe this the rather, <hi>Becauſe, as ſuch times have their ſpetiall evills, ſo, there's no evill that doth ſo ſuddenly ſurpriſe, and carry away the ſoule, as the ſin of the times, and of the Age:</hi> And that, becauſe it's a generall ſin, there's a croud goes along with that iniquity, and men doe uſually in the ſin and evill of times, goe from God. When an evill is generall, men ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it the more eaſily, and it's a hard thing even for a good man to eſcape that; therefore we ought the more eſpecially to be looking to that, and ſpeaking of that often one to another.</p>
            <p>When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> their great ſin was, miſtruſting God; their great duty was, to truſt in God, to believe in him, to reſt upon him; in all his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he did call upon them to performe this duty, but they murmured againſt God, and were full of unbelief; and this ſin was ſo generall, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuch a ſin of the time, that of fix hundred thouſand men that came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there were but two, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that eſcap't this rock, and went into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49133:126"/>undoubtedly there were many more good men among them, but they fell upon the common ſin of the Time.</p>
            <p>And when the people of God came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the great work of God then was, the building of the Temple; yet they cry out, <hi>the time is not come, the time is not come,</hi> and ſo there's a generall neglect of it by the whole Congregation; this was the evill of that time, and ſpread it ſelfe over good and bad; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed good men, that have eſcaped many other ſore and great evills, yet, when it came to this, the ſin of the Times, they have not been able to eſcape, but have fallen into it, not <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> nor <hi>Joſhua</hi> but are guilty.</p>
            <p>When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they could very well ſee and look upon the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry that was there committed, and yet keep themſelves very well from it; but when it came to be a ſin of the times, in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then they were catcht with it, and were ſplit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Rock; and if the Lord by ſpeciall grace and mercy doe not with-hold us, we ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſin; and it's wonderfull mercy and loving kindnes, that any ſoule doth eſcape the evill and ſin of the Times.</p>
            <p>But it may be asked,</p>
            <p>How ſhall we come to know the evill of the Times, that ſo we may eſcape and be kept from it?</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this,</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Let us take notice and obſerve that ſin which lyes diametrically oppoſite to the worke of God in the time:</hi> As in the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their work and duty was to believe and truſt in God,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49133:126"/>in an extraordinary way; now in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to this, they miſtruſt God, and that was then the ſin of the time: And ſo, in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> their work was to build the Temple, Gods Houſe; but in oppoſition to that, they build their owne Houſes, and neglect the work of building the Temple, and the Houſe of God lies waſt. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the Prophet, ſaying, Is it time for you, O yee, to dwell in your cieled houſes, and this houſe lye waſt?</hi> Why now, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were evident, that God hath written it in large and plaine Characters, that he that runs may read if he will, that THE PRESENT WORKE OF GOD IS, TO BRING DOWNE LOFTY MEN, TO LAY MEN LOW, AND TO THROW DOWNE ANTICHRIST; now if there be in oppoſition to this, <hi>an exalting of man, and ſetting up of Antichriſt;</hi> is God deſtroying Idols, and are men making of them? This is a neglecting the work of God, and going contrary to it, this is the ſin of the time. If there be a ſetting up of any ſuch thing, that God hath lift up his hand againſt (it's not raſhneſſe nor paſſion to ſpeak the truth of God, before God and the world, that) this is in oppoſition to the work of God: If God hath been throwing downe <hi>High things, the great ones of the world,</hi> and there is a ſetting up of thoſe things again, <hi>things that have the ſame ſtamp, and the ſame nature upon them</hi> that thoſe things had that were thrown down before them, this is the ſin and the evill of the times.</p>
            <p>And againe, Suppoſe it's clear that it hath been <hi>the worke of God, to appear againſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49133:127"/>whatſoever may be ſaid to have the marke of the Beaſt upon it it;</hi> now if ſo be, there be any thing in this time and age, <hi>ſet up againe, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath no other ground nor bottome for it to ſtand upon, but the wiſedome of man, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of man,</hi> and ſo ſhould intermeddle ſo far, as that the power of it ſhould be felt in the Churches of Chriſt, it's evident and plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, (and it's the ſpeaking of the truth of God, before God and the world to ſpeak it) that this is the ſin and evill of the times.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Take ſpeciall notice and obſerve, that ſin with which the moſt precious Saints and people of God are moſt taken, and drawne away from God by, that is the evill and ſin of the times;</hi> For that is uſually the ſin and evill of the times, which the Saints of God are moſt taken with, and embrace; for the ſin of the times doth not onely run through and run along with the wicked and profane of the world, but alſo the moſt precious ſervants of God: <hi>Moſes</hi> that meek ſervant of God, and <hi>Aaron</hi> that Saint of the Lord, were catched with it, in miſtruſting God; for the ſin of their time did not faſten upon the rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude onely, but upon thoſe two, and many other precious ſervants of the Lord. So, in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple, the ſin of neglecting that work, did not onely ſeize upon the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo it ſeized upon thoſe two brave ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men, <hi>Zerubabbel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> they were aſleep and neglected this work, as you may ſee by the words of <hi>Haggai;</hi> it had ſeized upon, and catched many of the precious Saints of God; and doubtleſſe, if the Lord did not keep us, there is none of us now here, that are ſpeaking of and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49133:127"/>againſt the evill of the times, but we ſhould without Gods great mercy and love to us, be catched and carried away with it, as well as any other.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Obſerve what that evill is, that though it runs up and downe without the leaſt controule or contradiction from the generality of men, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God hath a little Remnant that will oppoſe, and ſtand up againſt that ſin, and that evill; that is the ſin of the times.</hi> For obſerve it, to bear witneſſe to his cauſe in every age, God will have a <hi>handfull</hi> that will oppoſe themſelves to the evill of the times, and ordinarily but a <hi>handfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd and Apoſtatiz'd from God, and would have return'd againe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and made them a Captain, and miſtruſted God; then there was a little Remnant that ſtood up for God, and ſpake againſt that ſin, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> they ſtand up and plead for God againſt the whole Congregation, Let us (ſay they) not rebell againſt the Lord, let us not make us a Captain to goe back again into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for they ſhall be bread for us, the Lord will deliver them into our hand, we ſhall goe in and poſſeſs the Land which the Lord our God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thus they ſtand up and plead for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Congregation.</p>
            <p>And ſo in their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lord ſtir'd up a little Remnant to bear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt the ſin of that time; the Lord ſtir'd up the ſpirit of <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechary,</hi> againſt their ſin of neglecting the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and returning out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and where
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49133:128"/>God ſtirs up a ſpirit in a little Remnant to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the evill of the times, God is there, that is I ſay, a clear evidence that God is with them, and that God ſtands for them, and will owne them, when he ſtirs up a ſpirit in them to tell men their owne, for ſo did <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechary. Is it time for you, O yee, to dwell in your cieled houſes, and this houſe lye waſt?</hi> (I inſtance in thoſe two times, becauſe coming out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> being both Types of our deliverance from ſpirituall <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> nothing in the word is ſo pat to us, as the example of thoſe Ages.)</p>
            <p>I remember the Speech of a holy man yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, That if he were to ſtand with any party, he would ſtand with that party that was the leaſt, and that bore teſtimony againſt the ſin and evill of the times; looking upon this, that God was there, and with thoſe that ſtood up againſt and bore teſtimony againſt the ſin and evill of the times: When there's a controverſie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is an Apoſtacy or no, now the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men, of the proud men, they will ſay, no, there's no Apoſtacy at all, and ſo juſtifie their Apoſtacy; I, but what ſaith the little Remnant? what ſaith the few? they ſay, yes, there is an Apoſtacy, they ſay it's clear, and plain, and evident enough to them, that there is an Apoſtacy, though the generality ſee it not, will not know it, nor owne it, yet a little Remnant ſee it, and will declare and bear their teſtimony againſt it.</p>
            <p>But the ſecond thing we ſhould ſpeak often one to another of, is, <hi>The ſpeciall worke of God at that time, what the worke of God is, and what
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49133:128"/>the ſpeciall duty of Chriſtian is, in ſuch an evill and Apoſtatiſing time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are many Duties that in ſuch a day and age, lye upon the Saints, but I ſhall name but one or two, which are duties that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially lye upon the Saints.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This is one ſpeciall duty, <hi>To be humbled before God, and to labour to bring others to be humbled and lye low before him, for that ſin.</hi> In <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, he makes it his dayes work to be humbled and lye low before God for the ſin of the Congregation; he goes and ſpreads their ſin before the Lord, and lyes low to beg mercy and grace of God for the whole Congregation, and he labours alſo to bring the Congregation to this, to be humbled and lye low before the Lord. But</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>It's a ſpeciall duty of the Saints, and people of God in ſuch a day and time of Apoſtacy (whatever others ſay and thinke of it, yet I ſay it's the duty of Saints in ſuch a day) to appear for God, to ſtand up for God, to declare for God againſt thoſe ſins;</hi> Though others count it raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, haſtineſſe, and over-forwardneſſe, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it's the duty of the Saints, and is a good Principle to practice, in which we ſhould be found, if we will ſhew our love to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and his name, and his cauſe and intereſt, though all run from it. Thus in all ages, thoſe whom the Lord hath kept faithfull to himſelfe, have not onely kept themſelves pure from the evill of the times, but declared againſt it in others.</p>
            <p>So it was with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> they ſtood up for God, and proteſted for him, and declared
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49133:129"/>for him againſt the ſin of the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though they were but two, they will haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their lives for God; O, ſay they, doe not rebell againſt the Lord, doe not return againe into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And ſo <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechary,</hi> they would ſtand up for God, and declare for him againſt the Congregation, and tell them to their very faces, <hi>That they builded their owne houſes, but let the houſe of God lye waſt, whereas it was their worke and duty to build the houſe of God.</hi> They told the greateſt of them, the chiefeſt of them their ſin, and that to their faces; they Preached openly againſt the negligence and ſluggiſhneſſe of that Age to Gods work. And have not good men of latter times looked upon themſelves called to doe ſo againſt the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Age before us; Saints in all Ages have looked upon it as their duty to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the ſin and evill of the Age. Hence Chriſtians are called Witneſſes, a man that keeps all in his breaſt is no witneſſe, but he is a Witneſſe that gives forth a Teſtimony to others. And truly I ſpeak this, becauſe we may be holy and humble and wiſe in doing this our duty, in bearing witneſſe and teſtimony againſt the ſins of the times. O my thinks, when a Saint in cold blood ſhall ſit downe and conſider, that he ſees God, and his name, and his cauſe and intereſt blaſphemed, and trod under foot, and abuſed, and diſhonoured, and ſhall not ſtand up for God, nor appear for God, not have a word to ſpeak for God, how will this grieve him and trouble him? And may ſuch a one not queſtion his love to Chriſt? It's to be feared, we have but little love to Chriſt and his cauſe, his name
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49133:129"/>and intereſt, when we cannot ſpeak and appear for him; for men to have ſuch a Principle as this, I may ſtand by and look on, and ſee God and his name, cauſe and intereſt trodden under foot, and yet not ſpeak a word, but hold my peace and ſay nothing, and another may ſtand and look on, but ſay nothing, no man muſt ſpeak a word; truly, this is ſuch a piece of Doctrine that I never heard of, and that hath read ſuch Lectures already, as I think were never yet read: when they themſelves that doe ſuch things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know and ſee (and they that look on (it's ſo plaine, that they that run may read) that there is an Apoſtacy, and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none muſt ſpeak of theſe things, and bear te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt it, truly, it's ſuch a Principle and ſuch a piece of Doctrine as never was practiced by the Saints in former times. And if the Saints and people of God in former and later times had practiced ſuch a Doctrine and Principle as this is, they would never have loſt their lives as they did, there would not have died ſo many Saints as there did, there would never have been ſuch a large Book of Martyrs as there is; we ſhould never have had ſo many living Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of dying Saints as we have, if ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Principle as this had been practiced.</p>
            <p>If any ſay theſe men are good men though they have many and great failings. Why if it be ſo, this cannot excuſe the matter, Is a ſin the leſſe evill becauſe a good man commits it? And you cannot but acknowledge that if King <hi>Charls</hi> or the former Powers had don ſome things theſe men have done, you would not have put ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtructions upon them, and why
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49133:130"/>ſhould you think any thing the better of an evill becauſe you think good men commit it? It's not the badneſſe of any perſon that can make a good cauſe bad, nor the goodneſſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that can make a bad cauſe good; for though we and all the people of God have many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ties, yet that cannot make his good cauſe bad; the poor people of God (it hath been often upon my ſpirit, that they) ſhould be allowed their infirmities; in all times and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they have been allowed their infirmities, and truly the allowance now ſhould be larger and greater then ever it was in former times; and that upon the account of reaſon, becauſe they and their enemies have been brethren &amp; friends together; and I ſpeak this to this end that we may not goe and condemne all; (as I know this is the noiſe abroad) I am perſwaded when we come to ſtand before the Lord Jeſus our Judge, Chriſt will make another manner of judgement than now is made, and paſſe another manner of Sentence then now is paſt upon the Saints by men. And I am perſwaded if ſo be that good men would but ſtudy things, they would ſee more into them than they doe, I mean things by which God is diſhonoured, and his name blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and they ſee it not, and know it not: And they could not in ſuch a day as this but venture hard for God; This I am perſwaded is the truth of God, and many ſoules that doe not ſee it, God will make them one day aſhamed of it, that they have not had hearts for God, and tongues for God, and mouths for God in ſuch a day as this is, wherein his cauſe hath called for it.</p>
            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:49133:130"/>
            <p> Thirdly, Another duty that lyes upon the Saints in ſuch a day as this is, is, <hi>That they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their utmoſt the reformation of ſuch a thing. Ezra</hi> did ſo, he endeavoured to bring the Congregation upon their knees, and to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the ſin of that Age, of taking ſtrange wives, he cauſed the Congregation to enter into a Covenant to put them away, <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>But the third Generall Head is this, <hi>That the Saints ſhould be often ſpeaking one to another of the precious great and glorious Promiſes that God hath made of better times to come</hi> And we find the Prophets are full of theſe ſpeakings, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us of glorious times wherein we ſhall come to enjoy that which will make up all our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, afflictions and perſecutions. God bears up the hearts of his people this way, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and diſcovering of <hi>better times to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> God told them of <hi>a better time,</hi> promiſes them the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo, when his people were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> he made them a Promiſe of <hi>a better time</hi> to come, he told them, then in the time of their Captivity, to comfort and chear their hearts, that the time was coming wherein all the Kingdomes of the earth, and the power and greatneſſe of the Kingdome ſhall be given to the Saints of the moſt high; and with this Chriſt bears up the hearts of his Diſciples, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdome,</hi> ſaith he; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this will ſweeten the bitterneſſe of an evill time, this will make up ſuffering times, this will make amends for all, the Kingdome that Jeſus Chriſt will give unto thoſe that abide with him
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49133:131"/>in an evill time; as the Saints have had a day of Patience, ſo they ſhall have a day of Power; as they have had a day of ſorrow, ſo they ſhall have a day of joy; they ſhall have a day of Peace and Comfort, they ſhall have full peace, and full joy, yea, they ſhall have joy and peace running over, an overflowing of joy and peace, they ſhall have a day of power and rejoycing; and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking about ſuffering, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>I reckon, that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> O the thoughts of that time of glory and power, ſwallowes up all the thoughts of this time of ſuffering and of evill; I reckon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the ſufferings of this preſent world, are not worthy to be compared unto the glory which ſhall be revealed, which we ſhall enjoy, and be made pertakers of; with this <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts <hi>Timothy, If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo raigne with him:</hi> And whatever the poor blind world thinks, ſuffering Saints ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints; they that ſuffer with Chriſt, ſhall be glorified with Chriſt; the great thing that <hi>Paul</hi> preſents to the thoughts of the Saints in ſuffering times, to comfort them, and refreſh and bear up their hearts, is, that they ſhall have a Kingdome, they ſhall come into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and raigne with him there: There's a moſt excellent place for this purpoſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9, 10, 13 verſes. <hi>And they ſung a new Song, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the Booke, and to open the ſeales thereof; for thou waſt ſlaine, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49133:131"/>and Nation, and haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall raigne on earth. And every Creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying, Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> Now look into the next Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10, 11. <hi>And when he had opened the fifth Seale, I ſaw under the Altar the ſoules of them that were ſlaine for the word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held, and they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a loud voyce, ſaying, How long, O Lord, Holy and true, doeſt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white Robes were given unto every one of them.</hi> We ſee white Robes in one place under the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, crying, <hi>How long, How long O Lord, wilt thou not avenge our blood on them that dwelt upon the earth?</hi> And in another place we ſee them in their Kingdome, ſing Praiſes and Hallelujah's to God, and the Lamb; there they are in their glory, and in their triumph. O let us look to our white Robes, to keep our white Robes about us, for white Robes ſhall not alwayes lye under the Altar; O this we ſhould be often arguing of, and ſpeaking one to another of; O the ſweet and the great, and the glorious precious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that God hath made of <hi>better times to come;</hi> Let us make it our care (I ſay) to keep our white Robes about us, that in all our bearing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and appearing for God againſt the ſins of the Times, we may keep our white Robes: And then we ſhall conquer and overcome all our enemies; for that noble Spirit hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49133:132"/>come and conquered all along; though it hath been in the feweſt, &amp; never ſo weak &amp; deſpiſed a company, yet that noble Spirit hath conquered all along; though it hath been never ſo low, and never ſo contemptible, yet it hath carried it from the great and mighty and high ones of the world O let us ſpeak often one to another of theſe things, and this will quicken us, and keep a lively and active ſpirit in us, and among us; and therefore ſee what notice the Lord takes of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord hearkned and heard.</hi> O, God did hearken and liſten to hear what his Children did ſay for him, and to him, at ſuch a time as this was, wherein there was ſuch great and high Apoſtacies and backſlidings. It is, as when a man hears many ſpeaking againſt him, and his Child ſtands and looks on, and heares them; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will liſten and hearken to hear what his Child ſaith, and what his Child will ſpeak for him, he will take ſpeciall notice what his Child ſaith, and how he appears and ſtands up for him: Why ſo doth the Lord, when he ſees a company fall from him, and tread his name under foot, then he will take ſpeciall notice of them that ſpeak and appear for him; and not onely ſo, but</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Booke of Remembrance is written before him.</hi> Like unto a man that keeps a Note-book about him, to write down things, that ſo he may not forget them; ſo doth the Lord, (to ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men) the Lord hath a Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, and he writes downe what they doe that fear him, that fear his name, and ſpeak and plead for him, he writes it downe: O ſaith he, there's
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49133:132"/>ſuch a one, he ſpeaks for me, and he appears and pleads for me againſt the ſins of the times, O writt it downe preſently (ſaith God) I will not have that forgot, I will not looſe that note; when others revolt and turne their backs upon me, and when others look upon my name, and ſee it trodden under foot, and blaſphemed, they will not ſpeak for me, nor appear for me, but theſe doe, O write it downe, I will not forget that.</p>

               <hi>For them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</hi> O it's good to fear the Lord, to be of a fearfull ſpirit leſt we ſhould fall, and leſt we ſhould turne aſide with the croud, and with the workers of iniquity. to fear leaſt we ſhould backſlide and Apoſtatize, and ſee Gods name diſhonoured, and not appear for him, to ſpeak a word for him; it's good to be fearfull, leſt we ſhould be drawne and carried away with the ſtream; Let us pray often for one another, leſt we ſhould be led and drawne away.</p>
            <p>But theſe <hi>feare the Lord, and thought upon his name,</hi> though they could not ſpeak for God, nor it may be declare for God, as others did, yet they thought upon his name; they thought, how is the name of God diſhonoured? How is it ſpoken againſt and blaſphemed by this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy? How doth the name of God ſuffer? And thus they thought upon his name.</p>
            <p>But now theſe men to whom the Prophet ſpake, they forget God, and yet they ſay, <hi>Wherein have we forgotten God, and wherein have we done thus and thus?</hi> Well ſaith God, there's a company of poor ſoules that fear me and think upon my name, write it downe, write downe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49133:133"/>every thought that they have of me, and of my name, how that ſuffers, and how that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonoured; truly, if we can doe nothing elſe, let us think of the name of God at this day, how that ſuffers, and how that is trodden under foot; God took this exceeding well from them, and certainly God will take it well at our hands too.</p>
            <p>And ſaith God, <hi>They ſhall be mine in that day when I make up my Jewells:</hi> Thou ſhalt be mine ſaith God, and what would'ſt thou have God ſay to thee more than this, <hi>Thou ſhalt be mine in that day when I make up my Jewels;</hi> thou art mine now, but then at that day it ſhal appear that thou art mine: <hi>It doth not yet appear</hi> (as <hi>John</hi> ſaith) <hi>what we ſhall be, but when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him.</hi> Poor ſoule, what wouldſt thou have God ſay to thee more then this, <hi>Thou ſhalt be mine;</hi> God's <hi>thou ſhalt be mine,</hi> is more worth then all the world: If we could be but faithfull to God, he would gather us up to himſelfe, in that day when he makes up his Jewells. O ſaith God to his Angels, goe and gather up that ſoul, for that ſoule is mine, he is one of my Jewells. O, God will then ſhew what it is to owne him, God will make it appear plainly then, what we are, and who we are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>ſpare him as a man ſpareth his owne Son that ſerveth him;</hi> I will ſpare them and pity them; O, they have many weakneſſes and infirmities, what though? yet ſaith God, I will ſpare them; 'tis true ſaith God, they have many weakneſſes, and have much frowardneſſe, O but yet I will pardon all, and overlook all, <hi>I will ſpare them</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49133:133"/>all that; I ſee what they drive at, and what they aime at, I ſee what their ends are, they aime at my glory, at my honour, and they aime to be ſerviceable to me, and would very gladly doe ſomething forme, well, I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look and paſſe by all their weakneſſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and <hi>I will ſpare them as a man ſpares his Son that ſerves him:</hi> though their brethren and friends will not pardon nor forgive their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and their frowardneſſe, their weakneſſes and infirmities, yet ſaith God, <hi>I will, I will ſpare them.</hi> O Saints, here is our glory and our comfort, that our father, our God will ſpare us, he will over-look our infirmities; it's true Saints, we have many weakneſſes, much frowardneſſe of ſpirit, much paſſion, many failings, and many out-goings from God, and we cannot manage that bleſſed cauſe we have in our hands, with that wiſdome, and with that meekneſſe, and with that humility of ſpirit as we ſhould; O, but here's our comfort, we have a ſparing God, an over-looking and forgetting God. O Saints, our father will ſpare us, the father will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look our infirmities, he ſees we aime at his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and would doe ſervice for him, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights his heart; and certainly this will appear to be the great ſin of Saints one day, that they cannot forgive and forget and over-look one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers weakneſſes, and one anothers infirmities. O but here's the great comfort of the Saints in ſuch a time, that though they have many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities, yet they have a God and father will ſpare them and pardon them; Saints there's ſparing mercy in God, there's forgiving mercy in God, there's forgetting mercy in God,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49133:134"/>there's over-looking mercy in God: O the good Lord keep our hearts cloſe to him, and help us to keep our white Robes about us, and to walk in his feare alwayes; O let us caſt and venture our ſelves upon the rich grace of God in the New Covenant, and love in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p n="2">2 <hi>To conſider whether or no I will goe along with Gods glory ſo far till I come to the end of my owne intereſt, and then goe with God no further, if ſo, this is a clear evidence how great ſoever the zeale pretended might be for the glory of God, yet Gods glory was not my end.</hi> For if Gods glory had been the end, then the ſoule when it had come at the Butt (as I may ſay) that its owne intereſt would advance no further, yet it would have gone upon the pure account of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but now when I goe no further than the Butt where my owne intereſt is, I goe not one part of the way upon the account of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It's very remarkable that example of <hi>Jehu</hi> as to this, <hi>Jehu</hi> pretended high for the glory of God, but here was the tryall, when he came to that which ran croſſe to his own intereſt, there he ſtuck, be runs through the whole Commands of God concerning the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes that utterly; but when he came to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49133:138"/>Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethell,</hi> he could not deſtroy them, for that was contrary to his intereſt. And that very reaſon of ſtate that moved <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to ſet up the Calves, cauſed <hi>Jehu</hi> to keep them up, to keep up his intereſt, to enſure the Kingdome to himſelfe; therefore when he had gone juſt ſo far as he could with his owne intereſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and all the friends of <hi>Ahab,</hi> which conduc't to his ſettlement in the Kingdome, was ſuitable to his intereſt, he could goe no further; but when he ſaw he was to make an advance, and goe forth beyond his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, he muſt goe over the head of his intereſt, or follow God no further; he is at a ſtand; he goes up to the utmoſt bounds of his intereſt, to the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethell,</hi> but the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethell</hi> muſt ſtand, I will not meddle with them, I will not deſtroy my intereſt, this is a clear and evident Argument that all the ſteps he had made before was not for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but indeed for his own intereſt.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49133:145"/>and the Principle to be good; whereas a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man that hath a Principle of grace, doth oftentimes act his grace, even in his falls; for he never ſo falls, as wholly to looſe the life and activity in one way or other of this Principle, whilſt it's in him it will act, and if a mans fall ſhut it up from acting this way, it will act in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as fire incloſed may be ſhut up from breaking out in this place, but it will break out in another, whilſt there is fire you cannot keep it from breaking out: So, where there is grace it will vent in the time of falls one way or other; the activity of grace is as naturall to it, as the life of it.</p>
            <p>Now take a gratious man under falls, his fall ſhuts up the activity of grace as to this way, but grace being in him as fire ſhut up in his bones, will break out in ſome other way: There is an aptneſſe in man, though the way he is in be evill; yet when he can ſee an activity of grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to conclude thence, his way is good: As for inſtance, ſuppoſe a good man under ſome great fall, yet not convinced of it, but thinks otherwiſe, he finds his heart very willing to hear and receive a reproof, or to be ſhewed his evill from any, in this he ſees an acting of grace, and becauſe of it, he thinks his way is right; but this is a great miſtake, this comes from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace in him, not from the goodneſſe of his way.</p>
            <p>So alſo for grace in others; we ſee ſuch a man hath much grace, and upon that we think what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he holds muſt ſurely be the mind of God, hence we become his Diſciples, not from convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon our hearts from the word, but from
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49133:146"/>an adoration of his grace; this we are very prone to, and it is to make an Idoll of grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>When I give that to grace I ſhould give to Chriſt.</hi> As ſuppoſe, I have been acting, or I have ſeen another acting in this or the other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and abundance of grace, as faith, love, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath been acted in that duty, and ſome glorious effect hath followed thereupon, I now look upon the thing, and ſay, aye, this is for my grace; This is to make an abominable Idoll of grace, we give that to grace which is Chriſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why will God aboliſh Idolls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe his deſigne is to exalt himſelfe alone, and this, whilſt Idolls ſtand cannot be;</hi> Whilſt pomp, greatneſſe, ſtrength, pollicy, parts, and grace are Idolls, theſe are exalted; Some men therefore that ſpeak not a word of God all the year long, cry up this great man, or the other great man, commend him, and God is not exalted; others attribute this or that, to theirs, or ſuch a ones ſtrength, wit, or parts, or grace, are exalted, made Gods, but God is not exalted.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe Gods ſoule hates Idolls above all:</hi> For Idolls ſtrip God of his glory, and he can part with any thing better than his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How will God Aboliſh Idolls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>By the Manifeſtation of his owne glory.</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>Enter into the rocks, and hide thee in the duſt, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty.</hi>
